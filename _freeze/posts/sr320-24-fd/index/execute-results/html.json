Larvae were in 2 5k tanks. The night before there was a bit of a banjo filter clog but it seems no larvae were lost.\n\n![larvae](http://gannet.fish.washington.edu/seashell/snaps/Monosnap_Monosnap_2024-06-17_10-18-50.png){width=\"75%\"}\n\nWe were able to get 1 Million larvae. Those that were caught on 40um filter. The hatchery kept everything on 70 & 60 um filters which came out to be about 66 million.\n\n![larvae](<http://gannet.fish.washington.edu/seashell/snaps/Monosnap_Monosnap_2024-06-17_10-06-00.png>){width=\"75%\"}\n\nHuddls were at about 28C with algae pump set at 30 and algae tank getting 24 liters of algae (topped of with water). Flourometer counts were quite high \\~40 when larvae were added but we cannot figure out how it got that high. EDTA (0.04g) was added to 50 gallon header. Commercial group will be left in tanks for 8 days. We will try something similar.\n\n![system](http://gannet.fish.washington.edu/seashell/snaps/Monosnap_Monosnap_2024-06-17_10-17-35.png){width=\"75%\"}\n\n",
