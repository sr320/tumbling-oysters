Today, I started my day by signing into Zoom, which didn't take much time. I then spent a significant portion of my morning reading a scientific article on oyster reproductive processes and their impact on quality losses. This was followed by a deep dive into some data analysis, where I was working with R scripts and genomic data. This data analysis took up a large chunk of my day.

In the afternoon, I spent some time on GitHub, where I uploaded files related to DE gene expression and MWU analysis for Pacific oysters exposed to OsHV-1. This activity took a moderate amount of time. I also had a discussion on Slack about Rewind, a personalized AI tool. This discussion was relatively brief.

I also checked my email, where I was troubleshooting an error with a colleague who was experiencing the same issue. This took a fair amount of time as we were trying to resolve the issue.

In the midst of my work, I took a short break to check in with my family. I used the Find My app to see where everyone was located. I also had a quick chat with Beyer Roberts via iMessage. These personal activities were relatively brief.

Towards the end of the day, I checked my billing information for Scite, a tool I use for my research. This was a quick task. I also looked into how Rewind's compression works, as I was curious about the storage it might consume. This was a brief activity as well.

Finally, I wrapped up my day by checking my calendar for upcoming appointments and meetings. This was a quick activity, wrapping up a day filled with a mix of research, data analysis, and communication with colleagues and family.

I started my morning by checking my emails, where I reviewed a draft proposal from Megan Ewing. I then visited the GitHub profile of Ariana S. Huffmyer, a postdoctoral researcher studying the effects of climate change on coral physiology.

Next, I worked on a project in RStudio, which seemed to be related to my research. I also checked my Slack workspace, where I had several unread messages and upcoming meetings. I participated in a Zoom meeting with several of my colleagues, including Ross Cunning, Dr. Hollie Putnam, and Roger Nisbet.

I spent some time managing my files and possibly editing images or documents. I reviewed a document related to DNA methylation analysis and sex determination in oysters. I also engaged in a discussion on Slack about the next steps for analysis given the differential effects of haplotype on physiology and ITS2.

I visited the Roberts Lab Handbook, possibly to review lab protocols or guidelines. I also spent some time on a project related to oyster survival after heat challenges.

In summary, my morning was filled with a mix of collaborative meetings, individual work on research projects, and administrative tasks.

```         

# Define the vectors for controls and exposed
controls_females <- c("S16F", "S19F", "S39F", "S44F", "S52F", "S53F", "S54F", "S76F")
exposed_females <- c("S22F", "S29F", "S35F", "S36F", "S3F", "S41F", "S50F", "S77F") # Assuming "S77" was intended to be "S77F"


# Initialize an empty list to store the modified data frames
filtered_logdata_frames <- list()

# Loop through the list of data frames, filter, and add a source column
for (name in names(logdata_frames)) {
  # Filter the dataframe and add a new column 'Source' with the name of the dataframe
  filtered_logdata_frames[[name]] <- logdata_frames[[name]] %>%
    filter(GeneID == "LOC111099033") %>%
    mutate(Source = name) %>%
    mutate(Exposure_Status = case_when(
    Source %in% controls_females ~ "control",
    Source %in% exposed_females ~ "exposed",
    TRUE ~ NA_character_ # This line handles any Source not in the two lists
  ))

}

# Merge all the modified dataframes in the list into a new single dataframe
merged_dataframe <- bind_rows(filtered_logdata_frames)
```

```         
# Assuming merged_dataframe is your final data frame

# Reshape the data from wide to long format
long_dataframe <- pivot_longer(merged_dataframe, 
                               cols = starts_with("fold"),
                               names_to = "Fold",
                               values_to = "Value")

# Plot the data

PI Meeting

1.  Environmental information required for epigenetic tracking

-   Epigenetic changes must be biased by environmental cues
-   Random changes are unlikely to improve environmental matching

2.  Balance of addition and removal of epigenetic markers\

-   Rates must be approximately equal to avoid drifting to one state
-   Model formalizes optimal relative rates

3.  Defending model assumptions with empirical data

-   Evidence that stress increases epigenetic machinery
-   Time-series show changes in epigenetic modifications and gene expression after environmental triggers

4.  Location and mechanism-specific environmental sensing\

-   Examples show information transduced to specific epigenetic modifications
-   Histone modifications and DNA methylation reinforce responses

Molecular Mechanism Meeting

1.  Discussion about alcohol during interviews

-   Advice not to drink alcohol during dinner with interviewers
-   People often regret things they say after drinking

2.  Pipeline updates

-   Testing using R1 reads and merging reads for miRNA identification
-   Trimming R1 reads to 30bp and comparing results of merged reads

3.  Organizing meeting breakout rooms\

-   Creating introduction, methods, short RNA, and long RNA breakout rooms
-   Assigning meeting participants to relevant rooms

Summary

Today, I started my day with a meeting where we discussed the use of AI for note-taking, the impact of storm events on data analysis, and the progress of sequencing projects. We also discussed methylation analysis and planned for an intergroup collaboration meeting. After the meeting, I had a Zoom call with Steven Roberts and Megan Ewing.

I spent a significant part of my day working on a research project related to the molecular mechanisms in coral resilience and environmental triggers. I delved into the epigenetic modifications and their relationship to environmental changes. I also worked on a manuscript related to simulation and environment tracking.

I spent some time on my computer, navigating through various applications and websites. I checked my emails, visited the Roberts Lab website, and used the Slack application for communication. I also worked on gene expression data and referenced the Ostrea edulis genome assembly.

I worked on a proposal draft where I aimed to identify genes associated with sex determination in Olympia oysters and determine the impact of temperature on the expression of identified genes. I also referenced genomic data from the Roberts Lab GitHub repository.

I also spent some time reading a research paper on the gonad transcriptome analysis of pearl oyster Pinctada margaritifera, which helped me identify potential sex differentiation and sex-determining genes.

Throughout the day, I used various bioinformatics tools and databases for my research work. I used the NCBI database for genome assembly data , and I also used R for data analysis. I also referenced some code on GitHub for joining differentially expressed genes (DEGs) with Blast results and UniProt Gene Ontology annotations.

In summary, my day was filled with meetings, research work, data analysis, and reading relevant literature to support my ongoing projects. I interacted with my colleagues through various platforms and used a variety of tools and databases to aid my research.

# February 10

Today, I've been quite productive. I started my day by checking my calendar and planning my activities. I then focused on my research grants, reviewing and updating the information in the "Find Grants by PI R1209" document. I also worked on a spreadsheet related to my research funding, ensuring all the details were accurate and up-to-date.

In the midst of these tasks, I took some time to revisit a presentation I had prepared earlier, titled "2019-MonsterJam.key". I also looked at some old photos from my time at the Duke University Marine Lab. This brought back memories of the research and collaborations I had been part of during that period.

I also spent some time on the Roberts Lab website, updating information and reviewing recent activities. I made sure to update the status of various research projects and proposals. I also uploaded a document titled "2023_WSG_proposal-2.pdf" to Droplr.

Towards the end of the day, I revisited a manuscript titled "20230519_Revised_Manuscript - FFAR-Geoduck" on Google Drive. This allowed me to review the progress made on this research and plan for the next steps.

Overall, it's been a day filled with a mix of administrative tasks, research work, and a bit of reminiscing about past projects. I'm satisfied with the progress I've made and look forward to what tomorrow brings.
