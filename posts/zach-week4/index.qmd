## Background

-   Sampled gill tissue from snails located at 4 different sites along the central northern coast of Chile. 

-   Gill tissue was sampled in summer and winter

## Sequencing and lncRNA Identification

-   RNA-seq

-   lncRNA ID process filters for \>200 bp, coding potential (CPAT), and BLAST against Genbank protein sequence database for mussels

## Analysis

-   Expression analysis for both lncRNAs and coding RNAs

-   PCA, differential expression, and expression correlation between lnc and coding RNAs

-   Differential expression of lncRNAs by season

## PCA

-   More variability in expression over summer, less in winter

-   Punta Talca individuals most distinct from others

## Co-expression

-   Correlation of lncRNA expression with known coding RNA expression

-   lncRNA upregulation (A) most associated with stress response

-   Downregulation (B) most associated with metabolism

## My Main Takeaways

-   lncRNA expression showed seasonal variation as well as spatial variation--most notably in the case of a single site (thought to be due to more temperature variability at this site).

-   lncRNA expression appears to be very involved in stress response, translation, and metabolism--which play important roles during cases of environmental perturbation.

-   The author suggest that lncRNA genes may be more environmentally responsive than coding genes, implicating them more in rapid response to stress.
