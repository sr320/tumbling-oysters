PacBio data came from Wisconsin

Raw data at 
<https://owl.fish.washington.edu/nightingales/S_namaycush/LakeTrout/>

have 4 lean and 4 siscowets

they were run in three pools

Pool 1.   

Lean	FA047	bc2041	TATGATCACTGAGTAT.   
Siscowet	FA097	bc2071	CGAGTCTAGCGAGTAT.   
Siscowet	FA099	bc2072	TATCAGTAGTGAGTAT.   

Pool 2.     

Lean	FA094	bc2069	TCTATGACATGAGTAT.   
Lean	FA095	bc2070	TACTGCTCACGAGTAT.  
Siscowet	FA100	bc2073	ATCACTAGTCGAGTAT.  

Pool 3.    

Lean   FA092 - bc2068 ACTACGTGATGAGTAT.  
Siscowet FA253 - bc2096 ATGTACTAGTGAGTAT.

The first two pools arrived as Bams, and Sam demultiplexed.

The third pool arrived demultiplexed.


Sam generated corresponding fastq files

In transferring the fastq files to raven, those from Pool 3 seemed fine. Those from other pools ended abruptly. 

> Your FASTQ is truncated mid-record.
> We can tell because after the last complete read, it immediately starts a new @m84082_250614_101514_s4/76093130/ccs record but there’s no “+” line or quality block following it.


For those in Pool three just ran 

``` bash
/opt/anaconda/anaconda3/envs/nanoplot_env/bin/NanoPlot \
-t 40 \
--fastq ../data/pacbio-reads/fastq/m84082_251001_025627_s2.hifi_reads.bc2096.fastq \
-o ../analyses/08-nanoplot/bc2096
```

For those in pools 1 and 2 needed to a little bit of clean up.

eg 

``` bash
awk 'BEGIN{RS="@"; ORS=""} NR>1 { if (match($0, /\n\+/)) print "@" $0 }' \
../data/pacbio-reads/fastq/m84082_250614_101514_s4.hifi_reads.demux.bc2070--bc2070.fastq \
> ../data/pacbio-reads/fastq/m84082_250614_101514_s4.hifi_reads.demux.bc2070--bc2070--fixed.fastq
```
