Water temperature 23C. (Lagoon is currently at 17C). Two heater set at 36 set to come on 11pm - 5am daily.

Poly IC should arrive Monday. \n\n\n# Update Sunday Sept 15th\n\nWent out and did FW immersion (2 hours) on 75/76 and 56/66.\n\nAlso snapped photos for documenting size and number of seed. \n\n![Bag 30](http://gannet.fish.washington.edu/seashell/snaps/Monosnap_IMG_6967.png_2024-09-15_18-49-37.png)\nFull size images\n\n- [Bag 30a](http://gannet.fish.washington.edu/seashell/snaps/IMG_6967.png)\n\n- [Bag 30b](http://gannet.fish.washington.edu/seashell/snaps/IMG_6968.png)\n\n- [Bag 30c](http://gannet.fish.washington.edu/seashell/snaps/IMG_6969.png)\n",
