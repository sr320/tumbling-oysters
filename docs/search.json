    "section": "Discussion Themes",
    "text": "Discussion Themes\nOne of the central themes in our groups discussion encompassed the intra-species differences in molecular stress response across various marine invertebrate species. In regards to this theme, we particularly touched upon the transcriptomic responses in stress-tolerant vs stress-susceptible organisms of the same species to environmentally relevant stressors including extreme low salinity and elevation in temperature. The term “frontloading” used in Gleason and Burton 2015 is used to describe the baseline expression of genes that improve an organisms ability to physiologically tolerate extreme periods of stress.\nThis theme of frontloading and resilience across sub-populations of marine invertebrates differs slightly from the paper I selected that also cited the Gleason and Burton 2015 paper:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitation\n\n\n\nMorin, M., M. Jönsson, C. K. Wang, D. J. Craik, S. M. Degnan, and B. M. Degnan. 2023. Captivity induces a sweeping and sustained genomic response in a starfish. Molecular Ecology:mec.16947. https://doi.org/10.1111/mec.16947.\n\n\nHere the authors report the inability of a species of starfish to acclimate to the stress that comes with removal from their native environment and introduction into captivity by describing the distinct differences in the transcriptome of wild versus captive individuals. As they evaluated the transcriptomic profiles of wild and formerly-wild starfish, it can be said that the molecular marks of chronic stress expressed by the captive starfish contrast and thus highlight the theme of stress-response frontloading. Furthermore, the paper I selected also serves as evidence for the emphasis in integrating robust methods in research investigating differential gene expression."

However, when the stringency was relaxed, a high number of hits were observed. This suggests that there is some level of sequence similarity between lncRNAs and sRNAs, but it may not be functionally relevant (at least under stringent e-value settings).\nGenome Database: As expected, you see a vast number of hits when the e-value is not restricted. It narrows down to a more manageable number when stringency is increased, but still, a large number of hits are observed. This could be due to the fact that the lncRNAs are part of the genome, and thus, self-matches and paralogous sequences might be increasing the hits.\nProteome Database: The number of hits suggests that some of these lncRNAs might have regions that could be translated into protein sequences or resemble known proteins, although lncRNAs are generally not translated.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnalyze Overlap: You could analyze the overlapping hits between these databases to see if any lncRNAs show hits in all three databases.\nFunctional Annotation: Use other bioinformatic tools to predict the functional roles of the lncRNAs that show significant hits.\nAlignment Visualization: You might want to visualize some of these alignments to better understand the areas of similarity.\nStatistical Significance: You may also apply statistical tests to see if the number of hits in any of these databases is significantly higher than expected by chance.\nInvestigate Parameters: Review BLAST parameters like -max_target_seqs and -max_hsps based on your research questions, as these can impact your results.\n\nRemember, the number of hits alone doesn’t convey functional or biological significance; further investigation is needed."

    "text": "Summary\nFor our tutorial this week, I read the paper assigned to everyone, a Roberts lab special:\nRoberts SB and Gavery MR (2012) Is there a relationship between DNA methylation and phenotypic plasticity in invertebrates? Front. Physio. 2:116. doi: 10.3389/fphys.2011.00116\nwhich reviewed previous research on DNA methylation and phenotypic plasticity in invertebrates, particularly non-model organisms such as the western honeybee and the Pacific oyster.\nWe were required to find our own, more recent review though, which led me to this paper:\nSrut M (2021) Ecotoxicological epigenetics in invertebrates: Emerging tool for the evaluation of present and past pollution burden. Chemosphere. 282. doi: 10.1016/j.chemosphere.2021.131026 \nI will be giving summaries of both papers, comparing them, and describe an experiment that could integrate DNA methylation with my own interests in bivalve physiology.\n\n\nRoberts and Gavery Review\nThis paper summarized current work looking to link DNA methylation with phenotypic plasticity in non-model invertebrates. In summarizing previous studies, Steven and Mackenzie found that where DNA is methylated and its degree of methylation varies by species. Moreover, in species with methylation (such as bees and oysters), functionally critical genes were originally hypothesized (and shown in computer analyses) to be more methylated than tissue-specific or inducible genes, and for that methylation to carry through the germline (the next generation). The rationale is that less methylation allows for greater transcriptional flexibility, which makes sense for genes that are constantly turning on and off, unlike genes that need to be expressed constantly (such as DNA and RNA metabolism). With less methylation, the gene can be more easily accessed by transcriptional machinery. This was confirmed by Steven and Mackenzie’s sequencing of methylated regions in the oyster genome, and a study done on western honeybees. See image below.\n\n\n\nGene distribution\n\n\nMethylation also varied depending on the presence of introns. Methylated genes also appeared to be more conserved across species, and unmethylated genes have more genetic diversity and theoretically more adaptive potential and phenotypic plasticity, via more or fewer alternative splicings of a certain gene, and other pathways.\n\n\nSrut Review\nThis review focused on epigenetic modifications to invertebrate genomes following pollutant exposure, and the potential of using DNA methylation as a biomarker for pollution. The paper starts with a helpful review on what DNA methylation is and how it works before describing different studies of DNA methylation following pollutant exposure. The author then dives into how DNA methylation has changed in various invertebrates when exposed to metals, pesticides, harmful chemicals, radiation, BPA’s, etc. They include a three page table summarizing all the studies they could find. Next, they go into hypotheses of how pollutants alter methylation, with most of them involving hijacking or interruption of enzyme activity that carries out methylation. The next big chunk of the paper summarizes studies that have looked at DNA methylation after pollution over multiple generations after the original parent was exposed to a pollutant. Across multiple species and pollutants, they see mixes of hypo- and hypermethylation depending on the pollutant, the species, and the generation. The final part of the paper looks at challenges within the field of ecotoxicological epigenetics. Accessing robust bisulfite sequencing technology can often be prohibitively expensive, time-consuming, and heavily reliant on good expertise. Moreover, epigenetic data is often not linked to phenotypic expression within studies, and this is in part because of limited, well-characterized methylomes. The author also writes that in order for epigenetic data to be even relevant to ecotoxicology, the field must expand what organisms it uses so that it includes all ecologically relevant species, at different life stages, and all different tissues within an organism. The author concludes this section by saying that beyond DNA methylation, other gene regulatory (epigenetic) mechanisms need to be explored, such as non-coding RNA’s and histones.\n\n\nComparisons\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSimilarities\nDifferences\n\n\n\n\n-Agree that less DNA methylation is linked to increased plasticity -Both discussed DNA methylation in non-model organisms\n-Srut is much newer (2021), talks about more organisms and techniques -Srut talked more specifically about pollutant research, Roberts more about phenotypic plasticity -Srut’s paper talked more about genome wide methylation, Roberts more about specific genes\n\n\n\n\n\nApplications to my research\nI would love to do some targeted DNA methylation analysis in mussels that are exposed to high flow or low flow environments and see if that changes methylation in foot protein genes, given that mussels often lay more threads when exposed to higher flows. Although, that might not be super applicable, as we would likely need to see a change in the composition of the thread in order to make methylation analysis worthwhile. However, maybe there’s hypomethylation near the regulatory apparatus that controls byssal thread deposition. Could be interesting."

Mine looked at morphology and methylation in P. perna in South Africa across habitat types, either bay or open ocean mussels: https://doi.org/10.1007/s00227-018-3310-6.\nIf you want some quick summaries, look no further. You have arrived.\n\n\nTrigg et al. 2021\n3 different methods of methylation quantification (bisulfite sequencing) were used to compare methylation in two scleractinian coral species, one environmentally sensitive (P. acuta) and one not (M. capitata), and they also compared the efficacy of all three methods against each other. The three methods were whole genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS), reduced representation bisulfite sequncing (RRBS) and methyl-CpG binding domain bisulfite sequencing (MBDBS). WGBS is the top choice (and is the most expensive one) for bisulfite sequencing because it provides full coverage of the genome, and it can detect the entire methylome at single base-pair resolution, so you know exactly where the methylation is in a gene. RRBS uses restriction enzymes to enrich CPG islands, common methylation hotspots in vertebrates, but by using the enzymes only part of the genome is sequenced. MBDBS is described as “MBDBS uses methyl binding domain proteins to target and enrich methylated CpGs, then employs bisulfite conversion to provide single base-pair resolution of DNA fragments enriched for methylated regions.” Now I’m not sure hwat domain proteins are, but it sounds like these proteins find the methylated regions, and then the rest of the method uses the bisulfite conversion to provide that really high resolution.\nAcuta was far less methylated than capitata. Most of the methylation for both species was in the intergenic and intron regions. Whole genome bisulfite sequencing still comes out on top as the #1 method for figuring out methylation. However, for the corals, the MBDBS also worked pretty well for a much lower cost, with some potential misidentification of the symbiont’s genome as the coral’s genome, and a special focus on hypermethylated regions, which could be problems. RRBS covered less overall, but for what it did cover it got greater read depth. Inter-cell methylation differences may also affect MBDBS, which only pulls down methylated DNA, while the other two methods don’t “enrich” methylated regions.\n\n\nWatson et al. 2018\nThe authors used RRBS in tandem with morphological measurements to assess differences (epigenetic and otherwise) between bay and “open ocean” populations of P. perna (green-lipped mussels) in South Africa. They didn’t find any significant morphological differences between the two types of populations, but I guess they found some epigenetic difference, but the way they write about it makes it seem like they cherry-picked the data a bit. They did a PCoA with just “highly differentiated” methylation susceptible loci and then found a difference in methylation between the two types of populations, but that’s like having two piles of red apples, one with a green apple in it, and then picking up only the green apple and a red apple from the other basket and then saying “the two groups are different!” That’s my base understanding of it anyway.\n\n\nIn reference to last week\nIf last week was about the usage of DNA methylation quantification, this week was about what specific methods are best for DNA methylation quantification. We can safely say that WGBS is the best, but for marine labs that don’t quite have the same funding as those in genome sciences departments, MBDBS and RRBS could be useful enough for our purposes.\nInterestingly, last week I had an idea to look at methylation in mussels in high and low flow environments, and that’s what Watson et al. tried to do, which was cool to read. I’m not sure their data totally supports their conclusions, however."

    "text": "The paper I chose\nWithout mechanisms, theories and models in insect epigenetics remain a black box\nTLDR But what do we REALLY know about insect epigenetics?\nThe paper emphasizes the need to address the remarkable diversity of epigenomic systems in insects and nematodes by integrating genomic data with biochemical and single-cell-type analyses. It highlights the significant differences in epigenomic modification toolkits across taxa and suggests that they are utilized in a lineage-specific context, reflecting the evolutionary history of organisms.\nThe authors specifically focus on DNA methylation, which exhibits extraordinary diversity in animals, ranging from complete loss to expanded complements of DNMT. The study raises several unresolved questions regarding the evolutionary origins and organism-specific roles of DNA methylation systems, the transferability of data between different systems, and the distinguishing features of species without DNA methylation. Investigating organisms that have eliminated DNA methylation, such as Diptera, Placozoa, and certain Nematoda, may provide insights into the reasons behind this loss. The authors propose that eutelic or partly eutelic organisms, like Caenorhabditis elegans and tardigrades, eliminated DNA methylation to maintain strict development and enhance genome and transcriptome stability. The paper also highlights the unique case of DNA methylation in Hymenoptera, focusing on the honey bee. The honey bee’s DNA methylation toolkit exhibits variations, including gene duplication and alternative splicing, which may contribute to its phenotypic plasticity. Understanding the mechanistic aspects and functional importance of DNA methylation in insects, particularly in relation to development, behavioral maturation, and restricted gene expression, is crucial. The study acknowledges that the function of DNA methylation in insects remains poorly understood and emphasizes the need for high-resolution technologies to evaluate its involvement in development and behavioral maturation, especially in the honey bee queen-worker developmental divide. Additionally, the epigenetic control of gene expression in imaginal discs during insect development and the role of nutritional stimuli in reprogramming developmental processes are discussed as important areas of investigation."

    "text": "Comparison\nOne thing I find compelling similar about these two reviews is the call toward a better mechanistic understanding of how methylation impacts gene expression. However, I would say the Roberts and Gavery paper focuses more on functional description of the processes affected by methylation, while the Maleszka and Kucharski paper drives home the point that we cannot truly understand what methylation is actually doing without the explicit evaluation of pathways. Acknowledging that these two papers are written almost 10 years apart, it seems that some of this difference may be due to the progress in the field over the past decade. Using GO terms as a means to describe the potential functions of methylated areas appears to be the norm in most studies related to DNA methylation. It seems like we might be headed into a new era for invertebrates, born of research progress, in which we must look closer at mechanisms, similar to methylation studies completed in biomedical research, to truly test our hypotheses about DNA methylation in invertebrates. It’s also worth mentioning that both of these papers mention the transcriptional potential of unmethylated areas within the genome. Both papers likely operate under much of the same conceptual framework and ask questions about the role of DNA methylation in environmental response and preservation of necessary cellular functions (i.e. metabolism). However, the Maleszka and Kucharski paper does take specific issue with considering the functionality of all DMNTs as the same across taxa, as illustrated in Figure 1:\n\nFigure 1. DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) gene copy number and domain structure in selected organisms."

I’ve noticed that in framing research questions to describe the potential function of less studied epigenetic factors, clinging to a specific pathway, mechanism, or predicted response to the environment seems to be the clearest path forward. I’m also interested in looking at the interplay between methylation and lncRNAs, and I think the CEABiGR oyster dataset provides the perfect opportunity for this."

Lotterhos, J. B. Puritz, and H. M. Putnam. 2022. Invertebrate methylomes provide insight into mechanisms of environmental tolerance and reveal methodological biases. Molecular Ecology Resources 22:1247–1261.https://doi.org/10.1111/1755-0998.13542.\n\n\n\nTrigg et al. 2022 Summary:\nThis paper compares the effectiveness of three genome-wide level approaches for estimation of DNA methylation at single base-pair resolution in two non-model marine invertebrate organisms:\n\nWhole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS)\nReduce representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS)\nMethyl-CpG binding domain bisulfite sequencing (MBDBS)\n\nIn methylomics research, WGBS is the “gold standard” in bisulfite conversion sequencing as it is capable of providing full coverage of the whole methylome at a single base-pair resolution. However, this method is expensive relative to RRBS and MBDBS. Furthermore, given most marine invertebrates have a small fraction of their genomes methylated, the expense of evaluating the whole genome for methylation is not as attractive as other more affordable methods.\nRRBS enriches for CpG-rich regions of the genome through the use of restriction digestion. It was primarily designed for use in mammals that typically contain CpG islands in regulatory regions such as promoters.\nMBDBS involves the use of methyl binding domain proteins that target and enrich for methylated CpGs, then uses bisulfite conversion to ID at the single base-pair resolution fragments of DNA enriched for methylated regions. In marine invertebrates, this technique was projected to be especially useful as highly methylated areas of the genome tend to be found within gene bodies:\n\n\n\nexample of gene body\n\n\nAs such, generally speaking, since CDS regions tend to be methylated in marine invertebrates, using the enrichment approach involved in MBDBS is considered a cost-effective and method for investigating especially informative regions of the genome.\nUltimately, the authors find that the methylation landscape greatly varies across species, tissue processing methods, and library preparation methods. As such, when selecting for high-resolution quantification of DNA methylation profiles in non-model marine invertebrates, great consideration needs to be taken regarding the biology of the organism, the research question and resultant genomic regions of interest, as well as cost.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitation\n\n\n\nSun, D., H. Yu, and Q. Li. 2022. Genome-Wide Differential DNA Methylomes Provide Insights into the Infertility of Triploid Oysters. Marine Biotechnology 24:18–31.https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10126-021-10083-y.\n\n\nIn this paper, the authors investigate genome-wide methylomes and transcriptomes of fertile and infertile triploid pacific oysters and compare them to normal diploid individuals using whole genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) and RNA-seq with the objective of identifying the epigenetic mechanisms involved in gonadal development in triploid individuals.\nAn interesting finding out of this paper is that F-3nα, fertile female triploid pacific oysters, presented higher methylation levels than F-2n, normal diploid females. This contrasts with F-3nβ triploid infertile females that expressed lower methylation levels than F-2n. At first glance, this finding is intuitive, as at least previous discussions in FISH 600 have pointed towards the correlation of greater epigenetic modifications equating to greater regulation of gene expression. Since F-3nα individuals are still capable of producing a large amount of gametes despite the extra load of genomic material to control for, it would be expected to see greater investment in epigenetic modifications to the genome such as methylation especially relative to normal F-2n individuals. This idea is further supported by the evidence that F-3nβ individuals, who produce significantly less gametes, lack that epigenetic “control” of the excess genome and that may inform their ability to successfully undergo healthy gonadal development. Expanding upon this thought, the authors’ suggest that the absence of methylation in gene body regions of infertile triploid oysters likely leads to transcriptional effects relating to access to alternative start sites, alternative splicing events, and an overall increase in sequence mutations.\nThe authors pair this methylomic data with transcriptomic data and find that only 64 genes involved in metabolism are differentially expressed in fertile triploid females compared to the 272 genes in sterile triploid females relative to diploid females.\nIn terms of broader implications, this study presents a novel angle in terms of investigating gonadal development in invertebrates by evaluating epigenetic influences on the transcriptome of fertile and infertile pacific oysters.\n\n\n\nComparison with last meeting\nIn our previous meeting we discussed the broader implications of the epigenetic field and the general direction in which it was moving. This week however, we focus in on methods regarding high-throughput quantification of methylation landscapes and the direct applications of these methods such as the gold standard WGBS in elucidating mechanisms of epigenetic regulation in pathways such as gonadal development in marine invertebrates. Much of the work conducted in epigenetics is focused on methylation of the genome especially in vertebrates. The papers discussed here in this post focus in on the distinct nature of invertebrate methylomes relative to other taxa and how the unique biology of marine invertebrates like pacific oyster and coral result in methylation landscapes with unique gene expression regulatory properties."

Stephen said he would work on getting this exon count data into a matrix. They also agreed to read the methods section of a relevant paper to help inform their approach.

DNA methylation is an epigenetic mechanism that allows an organism to alter its genetic response to the environment without making permanent changes to its DNA.\nDNA methylation is one of the ways we understand the role of epigenetic response in organisms, but there are a few more; histone modification and non-coding RNA modification are the other mechanisms. While much work has been done to explain this temporary response to an environmental stressor, there is still plenty of work to be done with DNA methylation leading the way in research and understanding. With that said, DNA methylation manifests in either transcriptional regulation or in gene silencing and the Roberts & Gavery 2012 addresses both. While this paper was published in 2012, the role of DNA methylation as an epigenetic mechanism hasn’t changed.\nImage Caption: This graphic is from the Pham et al. 2023 review paper on epigenetic tool usage in elucidating the impact of contaminants in the aquatic environment."

    "text": "Research Application\nDNA methylation is an important variable in exploring Mytilus’ response to contaminants as the prevalence of larger and more frequent weather events pushes them to their energetic threshold of survival. The first exploration would be to quantify the percent cover of methylation across genes or physiological processes of interest and follow-up with lab experiments to determine adaptability to single- stressor and multiple- stressor environments.\nI am particularly interested in evaluating Mytilus spp. physiological response to PPCPs in coastal marine waterways through evaluating epigenetic response, heritability of response, and potential trade-offs in response to a challenging environment. An example of relevance to my work would be to quantify percent methylation coverage via BS-sequencing and follow-up with single contaminant exposure trials in mature mussels to tease out the trade-offs required to survive in a multiple-stressor environment. A control group would be exposed to standard environmental conditions prior to contaminant exposure. Treatment groups could include acute thermal stress, chronic thermal stress with a finite end, and long-term thermal stress exposures at temporal scales that mimic high temperature fluctuations related to seasonality. The next step would be to expose each treatment group to the same contaminant to determine the organism’s success in offloading the contaminant. Sampling of tissues would take place across a temporal scale that would yield the most complete picture of exposure response."

Different conditions we talked about were captivity, salinity levels, and temperature stress. Elevated thermal stress, lowered salinity, and captivity all elevated some stress related genes for all invertebrates. In particular, it seemed that organisms already living in stressful conditions had pre-adapted to their environment, as evidenced by a higher base level of stress gene activation than their unadapted counterparts. I learned what a long non-coding RNA is for the first time in my life, and I finally feel like I understand PCA graphs, to a certain extent."

I then spent a significant portion of my morning reading a scientific article on oyster reproductive processes and their impact on quality losses. This was followed by a deep dive into some data analysis, where I was working with R scripts and genomic data. This data analysis took up a large chunk of my day.\nIn the afternoon, I spent some time on GitHub, where I uploaded files related to DE gene expression and MWU analysis for Pacific oysters exposed to OsHV-1. This activity took a moderate amount of time. I also had a discussion on Slack about Rewind, a personalized AI tool. This discussion was relatively brief.\nI also checked my email, where I was troubleshooting an error with a colleague who was experiencing the same issue. This took a fair amount of time as we were trying to resolve the issue.\nIn the midst of my work, I took a short break to check in with my family. I used the Find My app to see where everyone was located. I also had a quick chat with Beyer Roberts via iMessage. These personal activities were relatively brief.\nTowards the end of the day, I checked my billing information for Scite, a tool I use for my research. This was a quick task. I also looked into how Rewind’s compression works, as I was curious about the storage it might consume. This was a brief activity as well.\nFinally, I wrapped up my day by checking my calendar for upcoming appointments and meetings. This was a quick activity, wrapping up a day filled with a mix of research, data analysis, and communication with colleagues and family.\n\n\nFebruary 9\nI started my morning by checking my emails, where I reviewed a draft proposal from Megan Ewing. I then visited the GitHub profile of Ariana S. Huffmyer, a postdoctoral researcher studying the effects of climate change on coral physiology.\nNext, I worked on a project in RStudio, which seemed to be related to my research. I also checked my Slack workspace, where I had several unread messages and upcoming meetings. I participated in a Zoom meeting with several of my colleagues, including Ross Cunning, Dr. Hollie Putnam, and Roger Nisbet.\nI spent some time managing my files and possibly editing images or documents. I reviewed a document related to DNA methylation analysis and sex determination in oysters. I also engaged in a discussion on Slack about the next steps for analysis given the differential effects of haplotype on physiology and ITS2.\nI visited the Roberts Lab Handbook, possibly to review lab protocols or guidelines. I also spent some time on a project related to oyster survival after heat challenges.\nIn summary, my morning was filled with a mix of collaborative meetings, individual work on research projects, and administrative tasks.\n\n# Define the vectors for controls and exposed\ncontrols_females &lt;- c(\"S16F\", \"S19F\", \"S39F\", \"S44F\", \"S52F\", \"S53F\", \"S54F\", \"S76F\")\nexposed_females &lt;- c(\"S22F\", \"S29F\", \"S35F\", \"S36F\", \"S3F\", \"S41F\", \"S50F\", \"S77F\") # Assuming \"S77\" was intended to be \"S77F\"\n\n\n# Initialize an empty list to store the modified data frames\nfiltered_logdata_frames &lt;- list()\n\n# Loop through the list of data frames, filter, and add a source column\nfor (name in names(logdata_frames)) {\n  # Filter the dataframe and add a new column 'Source' with the name of the dataframe\n  filtered_logdata_frames[[name]] &lt;- logdata_frames[[name]] %&gt;%\n    filter(GeneID == \"LOC111099033\") %&gt;%\n    mutate(Source = name) %&gt;%\n    mutate(Exposure_Status = case_when(\n    Source %in% controls_females ~ \"control\",\n    Source %in% exposed_females ~ \"exposed\",\n    TRUE ~ NA_character_ # This line handles any Source not in the two lists\n  ))\n\n}\n\n# Merge all the modified dataframes in the list into a new single dataframe\nmerged_dataframe &lt;- bind_rows(filtered_logdata_frames)\n# Assuming merged_dataframe is your final data frame\n\n# Reshape the data from wide to long format\nlong_dataframe &lt;- pivot_longer(merged_dataframe, \n                               cols = starts_with(\"fold\"),\n                               names_to = \"Fold\",\n                               values_to = \"Value\")\n\n# Plot the data\nggplot(long_dataframe, aes(x = Fold, y = Value, group = Source, color = Exposure_Status)) +\n  geom_line() +\n  geom_point() +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(title = \"LOC111099033\",\n       x = \"Fold\",\n       y = \"Value\") +\n  scale_color_viridis_d() # Optional: Use a viridis color scale for better visibility\nPI Meeting\n\nEnvironmental information required for epigenetic tracking\n\n\nEpigenetic changes must be biased by environmental cues\nRandom changes are unlikely to improve environmental matching\n\n\nBalance of addition and removal of epigenetic markers\n\n\n\nRates must be approximately equal to avoid drifting to one state\nModel formalizes optimal relative rates\n\n\nDefending model assumptions with empirical data\n\n\nEvidence that stress increases epigenetic machinery\nTime-series show changes in epigenetic modifications and gene expression after environmental triggers\n\n\nLocation and mechanism-specific environmental sensing\n\n\n\nExamples show information transduced to specific epigenetic modifications\nHistone modifications and DNA methylation reinforce responses\n\nMolecular Mechanism Meeting\n\nDiscussion about alcohol during interviews\n\n\nAdvice not to drink alcohol during dinner with interviewers\nPeople often regret things they say after drinking\n\n\nPipeline updates\n\n\nTesting using R1 reads and merging reads for miRNA identification\nTrimming R1 reads to 30bp and comparing results of merged reads\n\n\nOrganizing meeting breakout rooms\n\n\n\nCreating introduction, methods, short RNA, and long RNA breakout rooms\nAssigning meeting participants to relevant rooms\n\n\nIdentifying and comparing long non-coding RNAs across species\n\n\nGFF compare and size filtering of transcripts\nCoding potential calculator filtering\nHomology analysis using BLAST\n\nCode chunks for each species\nComparative BLASTs across species\n\n\n\nResults section introduction\n\n\nLack of results currently\nNumbers needed from filtering steps\nFigures from size distribution and BLAST results\n\n\nLinking to methods code and files\n\n\n\nCode locations for each species\nLinks to FASTA and BED files\nValidation of files needed\n\n---\nSummary\nToday, I started my day with a meeting where we discussed the use of AI for note-taking, the impact of storm events on data analysis, and the progress of sequencing projects. We also discussed methylation analysis and planned for an intergroup collaboration meeting. After the meeting, I had a Zoom call with Steven Roberts and Megan Ewing.\nI spent a significant part of my day working on a research project related to the molecular mechanisms in coral resilience and environmental triggers. I delved into the epigenetic modifications and their relationship to environmental changes. I also worked on a manuscript related to simulation and environment tracking.\nI spent some time on my computer, navigating through various applications and websites. I checked my emails, visited the Roberts Lab website, and used the Slack application for communication. I also worked on gene expression data and referenced the Ostrea edulis genome assembly.\nI worked on a proposal draft where I aimed to identify genes associated with sex determination in Olympia oysters and determine the impact of temperature on the expression of identified genes. I also referenced genomic data from the Roberts Lab GitHub repository.\nI also spent some time reading a research paper on the gonad transcriptome analysis of pearl oyster Pinctada margaritifera, which helped me identify potential sex differentiation and sex-determining genes.\nThroughout the day, I used various bioinformatics tools and databases for my research work. I used the NCBI database for genome assembly data , and I also used R for data analysis. I also referenced some code on GitHub for joining differentially expressed genes (DEGs) with Blast results and UniProt Gene Ontology annotations.\nIn summary, my day was filled with meetings, research work, data analysis, and reading relevant literature to support my ongoing projects. I interacted with my colleagues through various platforms and used a variety of tools and databases to aid my research.\n\n\nFebruary 10\nToday, I’ve been quite productive. I started my day by checking my calendar and planning my activities. I then focused on my research grants, reviewing and updating the information in the “Find Grants by PI R1209” document. I also worked on a spreadsheet related to my research funding, ensuring all the details were accurate and up-to-date.\nIn the midst of these tasks, I took some time to revisit a presentation I had prepared earlier, titled “2019-MonsterJam.key”. I also looked at some old photos from my time at the Duke University Marine Lab. This brought back memories of the research and collaborations I had been part of during that period.\nI also spent some time on the Roberts Lab website, updating information and reviewing recent activities. I made sure to update the status of various research projects and proposals. I also uploaded a document titled “2023_WSG_proposal-2.pdf” to Droplr.\nTowards the end of the day, I revisited a manuscript titled “20230519_Revised_Manuscript - FFAR-Geoduck” on Google Drive. This allowed me to review the progress made on this research and plan for the next steps.\nOverall, it’s been a day filled with a mix of administrative tasks, research work, and a bit of reminiscing about past projects. I’m satisfied with the progress I’ve made and look forward to what tomorrow brings.\n\n\nFebruary 11\nYour text here…\n\n\nFebruary 12\nYour text here…\n\n\nFebruary 13\nYour text here…\n\n\nFebruary 14\nYour text here…\n\n\nFebruary 15\nYour text here…\n\n\nFebruary 16\nYour text here…\n\n\nFebruary 17\nYour text here…\n\n\nFebruary 18\nYour text here…\n\n\nFebruary 19\nYour text here…\n\n\nFebruary 20\nYour text here…\n\n\nFebruary 21\nYour text here…\n\n\nFebruary 22\nYour text here…\n\n\nFebruary 23\nYour text here…\n\n\nFebruary 24\nYour text here…\n\n\nFebruary 25\nYour text here…\n\n\nFebruary 26\nYour text here…\n\n\nFebruary 27\nYour text here…\n\n\nFebruary 28\nYour text here…\n\n\nFebruary 29\nYour text here…\n\n\nFebruary 30\nYour text here…"

The analysis revealed a total of 1284 differentially methylated loci primarily in genes associated with development and stress response. The results suggest that DNA methylation may play a regulatory role in gonad and larval development, shaping the oysters’ responses to low pH stress. The study also highlights the importance of species- and tissue-specific studies to understand the potential regulatory role of DNA methylation.

You’re executing the program from its location.\n--vcf ../output/51-SNPs/EpiDiv_merged.vcf: This specifies the input VCF file that you’re going to work with.\n--recode --recode-INFO-all: The --recode option tells VCFtools to generate a new VCF file as output after performing all of the filtering operations. The --recode-INFO-all tells VCFtools to keep all INFO fields from the input VCF in the new output file.\n--min-alleles 2 --max-alleles 2: This filters the data to include only bi-allelic sites, meaning sites that have exactly two alleles (one could be the reference allele, and the other is the variant allele).\n--max-missing 0.5: This is a filter that sets a maximum allowable proportion of individuals with missing data at each site. In this case, it discards any variants where more than 50% of the data is missing.\n--mac 2: This option tells the program to only include sites with a Minor Allele Count of at least 2.

The --recode-INFO-all tells VCFtools to keep all INFO fields from the input VCF in the new output file.\n--min-alleles 2 --max-alleles 2: This filters the data to include only bi-allelic sites, meaning sites that have exactly two alleles (one could be the reference allele, and the other is the variant allele).\n--max-missing 0.5: This is a filter that sets a maximum allowable proportion of individuals with missing data at each site. In this case, it discards any variants where more than 50% of the data is missing.\n--mac 2: This option tells the program to only include sites with a Minor Allele Count of at least 2. This means that the less common variant must appear at least twice in your sample.\n--out ../output/51-SNPs/EpiDiv_merged.f: This is the location and prefix of the output files.

    "text": "Take Home Points\n\nTrigg et al. (2022)\n[]\n\nWe evaluated the performance of three approaches that use bisulfite-­treated DNA for library preparation to enable single base-­pair resolution quantification of DNA methylation in corals.\nwhole genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS)\nmethyl-CpG binding domain bisulfite sequencing (MBDBS)\nreduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS)\nTaken together, our findings indicate biology, genome architecture, regions of interest, and depth of coverage are critical considerations when choosing methods for high-resolution quantification of DNA methylation profiles in invertebrates.\nOur results demonstrate that the methylation landscape can vary significantly across species, which is a critical consideration for both interpreting environmental response capacity, and for experimental design.\nTogether these metrics enable comparative capacity for three common methods in two coral taxa that vary in their phylogeny, genome size, symbiotic unions and environmental performance, and provide the community with a more comprehensive foundation upon which to build laboratory and statistical analyses of DNA methylation, plasticity and acclimatization.\n\n\n\nTang et al. (2023)\n[]\n\nWe aimed to explore the purpose of exploring the mechanism of reproductive endocrine disruption and DNA methylation in female C. farreri under stress from B[a]P by detecting the gonad index, hormone content, ovarian development, and indicators related to DNA methylation in the ovary.\n\nWe speculate that B[a]P stress may affect DNA methylation of key genes involved in steroid hormone synthesis.\n\n\nIt has been reported that abnormal gene expression and related toxicological effects after exposure to pollutants may be caused by DNA methylation.\n\nThe high methylation level of hsd17β promoter may be one of the reasons for the reproductive toxicity of C. farreri caused by B[a]P stress.\n\nRecent studies have found that abnormal methylation of promoters in key reproductive genes has endocrine disrupting effects on mammals and teleost fish after exposure to POPs.\n\nTeam used qPCR and specific primers to find that the results of the analysis showed that the methylation level of the er promoter was low and that B[a]P had no obvious effect on the level of DNA methylation of female scallops at different concentrations and times."

    "text": "Scientific Relevance / Impact\nAs both papers discuss, the experimental design as well as the biology of the organism are crucial to understand as clearly as possible. What are your goals, one target gene or many? Transcription alteration or gene silencing? Do you have a reference or not?\nAll of these question lead to the big dog, how much money is there and what do you need to prove your hypothesis? For a single function/ gene/ enzyme, the cost of primers and qPCR supplies may be all that we need. Do you need to characterize a whole chunk of genome? Maybe RRBS before looking to WGBS.\nHaving multiple methods supports diversity in questions asked and answered with the flexibility to obtain only the data you need versus being inundated with an expensive and data-dense output that takes too many man-hours to process."
