    "text": "ntic](“https://github.com/sr320/tumbling-oysters/blob/main/posts/ChrisPosts/epigenticPath.png?raw=true”) ---\nQuite candidly, I have been conflating types of DNA methylation and this week’s readings helped me get to the bottom of why I was struggling to grasp the conceptual understanding of different types of DNA methylation. But first, let’s back up and get on the same page. DNA methylation is an epigenetic mechanism that allows an organism to alter its genetic response to the environment without making permanent changes to its DNA.\nDNA methylation is one of the ways we understand the role of epigenetic response in organisms, but there are a few more; histone modification and non-coding RNA modification are the other mechanisms. While much work has been done to explain this temporary response to an environmental stressor, there is still plenty of work to be done with DNA methylation leading the way in research and understanding. With that said, DNA methylation manifests in either transcriptional regulation or in gene silencing and the Roberts & Gavery 2012 addresses both. While this paper was published in 2012, the role of DNA methylation as an epigenetic mechanism hasn’t changed.\nImage Caption: This graphic is from the Pham et al. 2023 review paper on epigenetic tool usage in elucidating the impact of contaminants in the aquatic environment."

The first exploration would be to quantify the percent cover of methylation across genes or physiological processes of interest and follow-up with lab experiments to determine adaptability to single- stressor and multiple- stressor environments.\nI am particularly interested in evaluating Mytilus spp. physiological response to PPCPs in coastal marine waterways through evaluating epigenetic response, heritability of response, and potential trade-offs in response to a challenging environment. An example of relevance to my work would be to quantify percent methylation coverage via BS-sequencing and follow-up with single contaminant exposure trials in mature mussels to tease out the trade-offs required to survive in a multiple-stressor environment. A control group would be exposed to standard environmental conditions prior to contaminant exposure. Treatment groups could include acute thermal stress, chronic thermal stress with a finite end, and long-term thermal stress exposures at temporal scales that mimic high temperature fluctuations related to seasonality. The next step would be to expose each treatment group to the same contaminant to determine the organism’s success in offloading the contaminant. Sampling of tissues would take place across a temporal scale that would yield the most complete picture of exposure response."

The term “frontloading” used in Gleason and Burton 2015 is used to describe the baseline expression of genes that improve an organisms ability to physiologically tolerate extreme periods of stress.\nThis theme of frontloading and resilience across sub-populations of marine invertebrates differs slightly from the paper I selected that also cited the Gleason and Burton 2015 paper:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitation\n\n\n\nMorin, M., M.

Molecular Ecology:mec.16947. https://doi.org/10.1111/mec.16947.\n\n\nHere the authors report the inability of a species of starfish to acclimate to the stress that comes with removal from their native environment and introduction into captivity by describing the distinct differences in the transcriptome of wild versus captive individuals. As they evaluated the transcriptomic profiles of wild and formerly-wild starfish, it can be said that the molecular marks of chronic stress expressed by the captive starfish contrast and thus highlight the theme of stress-response frontloading. Furthermore, the paper I selected also serves as evidence for the emphasis in integrating robust methods in research investigating differential gene expression."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Summary\nFor our tutorial this week, I read the paper assigned to everyone, a Roberts lab special:\nRoberts SB and Gavery MR (2012) Is there a relationship between DNA methylation and phenotypic plasticity in invertebrates? Front. Physio. 2:116. doi: 10.3389/fphys.2011.00116\nwhich reviewed previous research on DNA methylation and phenotypic plasticity in invertebrates, particularly non-model organisms such as the western honeybee and the Pacific oyster.\nWe were required to find our own, more recent review though, which led me to this paper:\nSrut M (2021) Ecotoxicological epigenetics in invertebrates: Emerging tool for the evaluation of present and past pollution burden. Chemosphere. 282. doi: 10.1016/j.chemosphere.2021.131026 \nI will be giving summaries of both papers, comparing them, and describe an experiment that could integrate DNA methylation with my own interests in bivalve physiology.\n\n\nRoberts and Gavery Review\nThis paper summarized current work looking to link DNA methylation with phenotypic plasticity in non-model invertebrates. In summarizing previous studies, Steven and Mackenzie found that where DNA is methylated and its degree of methylation varies by species. Moreover, in species with methylation (such as bees and oysters), functionally critical genes were originally hypothesized (and shown in computer analyses) to be more methylated than tissue-specific or inducible genes, and for that methylation to carry through the germline (the next generation). The rationale is that less methylation allows for greater transcriptional flexibility, which makes sense for genes that are constantly turning on and off, unlike genes that need to be expressed constantly (such as DNA and RNA metabolism). With less methylation, the gene can be more easily accessed by transcriptional machinery. This was confirmed by Steven and Mackenzie’s sequencing of methylated regions in the oyster genome, and a study done on western honeybees. See image below.\n\n\n\nGene distribution\n\n\nMethylation also varied depending on the presence of introns. Methylated genes also appeared to be more conserved across species, and unmethylated genes have more genetic diversity and theoretically more adaptive potential and phenotypic plasticity, via more or fewer alternative splicings of a certain gene, and other pathways.\n\n\nSrut Review\nThis review focused on epigenetic modifications to invertebrate genomes following pollutant exposure, and the potential of using DNA methylation as a biomarker for pollution. The paper starts with a helpful review on what DNA methylation is and how it works before describing different studies of DNA methylation following pollutant exposure. The author then dives into how DNA methylation has changed in various invertebrates when exposed to metals, pesticides, harmful chemicals, radiation, BPA’s, etc. They include a three page table summarizing all the studies they could find. Next, they go into hypotheses of how pollutants alter methylation, with most of them involving hijacking or interruption of enzyme activity that carries out methylation. The next big chunk of the paper summarizes studies that have looked at DNA methylation after pollution over multiple generations after the original parent was exposed to a pollutant. Across multiple species and pollutants, they see mixes of hypo- and hypermethylation depending on the pollutant, the species, and the generation. The final part of the paper looks at challenges within the field of ecotoxicological epigenetics. Accessing robust bisulfite sequencing technology can often be prohibitively expensive, time-consuming, and heavily reliant on good expertise. Moreover, epigenetic data is often not linked to phenotypic expression within studies, and this is in part because of limited, well-characterized methylomes. The author also writes that in order for epigenetic data to be even relevant to ecotoxicology, the field must expand what organisms it uses so that it includes all ecologically relevant species, at different life stages, and all different tissues within an organism. The author concludes this section by saying that beyond DNA methylation, other gene regulatory (epigenetic) mechanisms need to be explored, such as non-coding RNA’s and histones.\n\n\nComparisons\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSimilarities\nDifferences\n\n\n\n\n-Agree that less DNA methylation is linked to increased plasticity -Both discussed DNA methylation in non-model organisms\n-Srut is much newer (2021), talks about more organisms and techniques -Srut talked more specifically about pollutant research, Roberts more about phenotypic plasticity -Srut’s paper talked more about genome wide methylation, Roberts more about specific genes\n\n\n\n\n\nApplications to my research\nI would love to do some targeted DNA methylation analysis in mussels that are exposed to high flow or low flow environments and see if that changes methylation in foot protein genes, given that mussels often lay more threads when exposed to higher flows. Although, that might not be super applicable, as we would likely need to see a change in the composition of the thread in order to make methylation analysis worthwhile. However, maybe there’s hypomethylation near the regulatory apparatus that controls byssal thread deposition. Could be interesting."

    "text": "Summary\nFor the last week of our tutorial, we came back to DNA methylation and read another Roberts lab joint: https://doi.org/10.1111/1755-0998.13542\nAnd we also got to read another paper on our organism of choice. Mine looked at morphology and methylation in P. perna in South Africa across habitat types, either bay or open ocean mussels: https://doi.org/10.1007/s00227-018-3310-6.\nIf you want some quick summaries, look no further. You have arrived.\n\n\nTrigg et al. 2021\n3 different methods of methylation quantification (bisulfite sequencing) were used to compare methylation in two scleractinian coral species, one environmentally sensitive (P. acuta) and one not (M. capitata), and they also compared the efficacy of all three methods against each other. The three methods were whole genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS), reduced representation bisulfite sequncing (RRBS) and methyl-CpG binding domain bisulfite sequencing (MBDBS). WGBS is the top choice (and is the most expensive one) for bisulfite sequencing because it provides full coverage of the genome, and it can detect the entire methylome at single base-pair resolution, so you know exactly where the methylation is in a gene. RRBS uses restriction enzymes to enrich CPG islands, common methylation hotspots in vertebrates, but by using the enzymes only part of the genome is sequenced. MBDBS is described as “MBDBS uses methyl binding domain proteins to target and enrich methylated CpGs, then employs bisulfite conversion to provide single base-pair resolution of DNA fragments enriched for methylated regions.” Now I’m not sure hwat domain proteins are, but it sounds like these proteins find the methylated regions, and then the rest of the method uses the bisulfite conversion to provide that really high resolution.\nAcuta was far less methylated than capitata. Most of the methylation for both species was in the intergenic and intron regions. Whole genome bisulfite sequencing still comes out on top as the #1 method for figuring out methylation. However, for the corals, the MBDBS also worked pretty well for a much lower cost, with some potential misidentification of the symbiont’s genome as the coral’s genome, and a special focus on hypermethylated regions, which could be problems. RRBS covered less overall, but for what it did cover it got greater read depth. Inter-cell methylation differences may also affect MBDBS, which only pulls down methylated DNA, while the other two methods don’t “enrich” methylated regions.\n\n\nWatson et al. 2018\nThe authors used RRBS in tandem with morphological measurements to assess differences (epigenetic and otherwise) between bay and “open ocean” populations of P. perna (green-lipped mussels) in South Africa. They didn’t find any significant morphological differences between the two types of populations, but I guess they found some epigenetic difference, but the way they write about it makes it seem like they cherry-picked the data a bit. They did a PCoA with just “highly differentiated” methylation susceptible loci and then found a difference in methylation between the two types of populations, but that’s like having two piles of red apples, one with a green apple in it, and then picking up only the green apple and a red apple from the other basket and then saying “the two groups are different!” That’s my base understanding of it anyway.\n\n\nIn reference to last week\nIf last week was about the usage of DNA methylation quantification, this week was about what specific methods are best for DNA methylation quantification. We can safely say that WGBS is the best, but for marine labs that don’t quite have the same funding as those in genome sciences departments, MBDBS and RRBS could be useful enough for our purposes.\nInterestingly, last week I had an idea to look at methylation in mussels in high and low flow environments, and that’s what Watson et al. tried to do, which was cool to read. I’m not sure their data totally supports their conclusions, however."

    "text": "Is There a Relationship between DNA Methylation and Phenotypic Plasticity in Invertebrates?\nTLDR Yeah seems like it\nThis paper highlights the importance of DNA methylation in invertebrates and suggests that its absence in certain genes contributes to phenotypic variation, which can enhance adaptive potential in fluctuating environments.\nWhile DNA methylation has been extensively studied in mammals and plants, there is limited knowledge about this mechanism in invertebrates. The relative amount of DNA methylation varies significantly across taxa, with vertebrates exhibiting global methylation, while invertebrates show a wide range of methylation patterns. In invertebrates, DNA methylation patterns are associated with gene coding regions. Computational analysis has shown that genes predicted to be methylated in the germline have lower genetic diversity compared to unmethylated genes. Experimental studies in invertebrates, such as oysters and bees, have confirmed these findings and revealed that methylated genes are involved in critical biological processes, while unmethylated genes are associated with tissue-specific and inducible expression. The absence of germline methylation in genes involved in responding to environmental changes is proposed to facilitate phenotypic plasticity and increase adaptive potential. This absence of methylation allows for various transcriptional opportunities, including alternative transcription start sites, increased sequence mutations, and exon skipping. DNA methylation can act as a regulatory mechanism for controlling gene expression and influencing ecologically important traits. However, there are still unanswered questions regarding the mechanisms underlying the relationship between DNA methylation and transcriptional opportunities in invertebrates. Further research is needed to understand the specific roles of DNA methylation in different invertebrate species and their evolutionary implications."

It highlights the significant differences in epigenomic modification toolkits across taxa and suggests that they are utilized in a lineage-specific context, reflecting the evolutionary history of organisms.\nThe authors specifically focus on DNA methylation, which exhibits extraordinary diversity in animals, ranging from complete loss to expanded complements of DNMT. The study raises several unresolved questions regarding the evolutionary origins and organism-specific roles of DNA methylation systems, the transferability of data between different systems, and the distinguishing features of species without DNA methylation. Investigating organisms that have eliminated DNA methylation, such as Diptera, Placozoa, and certain Nematoda, may provide insights into the reasons behind this loss. The authors propose that eutelic or partly eutelic organisms, like Caenorhabditis elegans and tardigrades, eliminated DNA methylation to maintain strict development and enhance genome and transcriptome stability. The paper also highlights the unique case of DNA methylation in Hymenoptera, focusing on the honey bee. The honey bee’s DNA methylation toolkit exhibits variations, including gene duplication and alternative splicing, which may contribute to its phenotypic plasticity. Understanding the mechanistic aspects and functional importance of DNA methylation in insects, particularly in relation to development, behavioral maturation, and restricted gene expression, is crucial. The study acknowledges that the function of DNA methylation in insects remains poorly understood and emphasizes the need for high-resolution technologies to evaluate its involvement in development and behavioral maturation, especially in the honey bee queen-worker developmental divide. Additionally, the epigenetic control of gene expression in imaginal discs during insect development and the role of nutritional stimuli in reprogramming developmental processes are discussed as important areas of investigation."

    "text": "Comparison\nOne thing I find compelling similar about these two reviews is the call toward a better mechanistic understanding of how methylation impacts gene expression. However, I would say the Roberts and Gavery paper focuses more on functional description of the processes affected by methylation, while the Maleszka and Kucharski paper drives home the point that we cannot truly understand what methylation is actually doing without the explicit evaluation of pathways. Acknowledging that these two papers are written almost 10 years apart, it seems that some of this difference may be due to the progress in the field over the past decade. Using GO terms as a means to describe the potential functions of methylated areas appears to be the norm in most studies related to DNA methylation. It seems like we might be headed into a new era for invertebrates, born of research progress, in which we must look closer at mechanisms, similar to methylation studies completed in biomedical research, to truly test our hypotheses about DNA methylation in invertebrates. It’s also worth mentioning that both of these papers mention the transcriptional potential of unmethylated areas within the genome. Both papers likely operate under much of the same conceptual framework and ask questions about the role of DNA methylation in environmental response and preservation of necessary cellular functions (i.e. metabolism). However, the Maleszka and Kucharski paper does take specific issue with considering the functionality of all DMNTs as the same across taxa, as illustrated in Figure 1:\n\nFigure 1. DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) gene copy number and domain structure in selected organisms."

In particular, it seemed that organisms already living in stressful conditions had pre-adapted to their environment, as evidenced by a higher base level of stress gene activation than their unadapted counterparts.

    "text": "This week we read Gleason & Burton’s 2015 RNA-seq reveals regional differences in transcriptome response to heat stress in the marine snail Chlorostoma funebralis and found individual papers that cited this one. Gleason and Burton noted that there were regional differences in the same species’ response to thermal stress by monitoring the HSP70 and HSP 90 expression in a northern and southern population of snails. Their findings question the molecular mechanisms that induce expression of the HSPs and other molecular chaperones.\nI chose a 2021 paper from Clark, Peck and Thyrring, Resilience in Greenland intertidal Mytilus: The hidden stress defense. This paper explores a similar concept as Gleason & Burton with the study species as Mytilus edulis. The most interesting finding from this paper was that these mussels were able torecruit a response from a whole different family of HSPs, HSPA12. This is a fascinating concept as this gene family is linked to increased copy number of the gene and the preparedness of Mytilus to protect itself from environmental stressors. Essentially, if the mussel is ‘primed’ it can essentially get ready for the upcoming stressors and manage a defense, it is called hardening. Very cool.\nWhile we all read papers that cited the Gleason & Burton paper, I feel like the findings in this paper are most applicable to my work as contaminants add to an already stressed environment. When faced with dirty water and elevated temperatures it feels bleak to think about the health of the aquatic organisms, but knowing they have defenses that they can harness while we work toward cleaning up our mess it hopeful."
