Sam had run a series of ranks to see which one was most appropriate. Specifically he ran from 5-75.

It looks like 35 is where we go forward

-   • Gene sparsity increases sharply after rank 35.

Comparison of GO terms

Key Findings The top 5 biological processes across all rank 35 components are:\
- Innate immune response - 80 occurrences across 27 components.\
- Proteolysis - 79 occurrences across 25 components.\
- Positive regulation of gene expression - 78 occurrences across 27 components.\
- Defense response to Gram-negative bacterium - 76 occurrences across 30 components.\
- Positive regulation of transcription by RNA polymerase II - 76 occurrences across 21 components.

Some of this is part is driven by Group IDs in multiple components
