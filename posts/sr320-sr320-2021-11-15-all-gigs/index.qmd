Here want to take all the gigas - [previously described and Bismarked](https://sr320.github.io/Gigome/) - and see what we can glean from methylkit.



Run on Raven - code -> https://github.com/sr320/nb-2021/blob/main/C_gigas/code/60-allgig-methylkit.Rmd



```
wget -r \

--no-directories --no-parent \
-P /media/1TB_ext_SSD01/sr320/wd/ \
-A *sorted.bam \

Running
```
myDiff=calculateDiffMeth(meth_filter,mc.cores=36)
```
and
```
# get hyper methylated bases
myDiff_a50p.hyper=getMethylDiff(myDiff,difference=50,qvalue=0.01,type="hyper")
#
# get hypo methylated bases
myDiff_a50p.hypo=getMethylDiff(myDiff,difference=50,qvalue=0.01,type="hypo")
#
#
# get all differentially methylated bases
myDiff_a50p=getMethylDiff(myDiff,difference=50,qvalue=0.01)
```
only gets 1 DML. Likely related to so few loci with coverage..
