On the 17th Madeline set up an incubator to see how long it would take oysters to die- [POST](https://genefish.wordpress.com/2024/06/17/6-17-24/)


On the 18th we saw no signs of death but added oysters in water.. in beakers and 12-well plate

Camera monitoring of adults has yet to observe gapping

On the 20th there was death likely in dry oysters based on smell but no visual indication of gaping. 

The oysters in the 12 well plate had gapers. 5/6 of oysters in freshwater were gaping and 3/6 of oyster in seawater were gaping. 
*This equates to gaping at 48 hours*. 

On the same day oysters were placed in 12 well plate and clear tupperware.

Note that we went with both "large" and "small" in 12-well plate. The last cohort in the 12-well were all "small".

Oyster were check by Kathleen on June 21 with no gaping. 

Camera shows no gaping on adults on 21.
