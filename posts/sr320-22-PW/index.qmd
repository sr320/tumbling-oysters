We went out to the hatchery twice this week to clean up inventory and get prepped for spawning. We tagged a long for the second commercial spawn of the year.

# New bags

On the near 10-holers there were 5 bags that were fouled and likely our PH stocks

In A there were two bags re-labelled with White Tags: 31 and 2.

In B there were two bags re-labelled with White Tags: 13 and 17. 13 had blue tie wraps on top and bottom (and black on top). 17 had black tie wrap at top. It is assummed blue are BLUE.
