A couple of pipes in control fell. Temperature was 13.9. Installed header heater to 16.\n\n# November 2\n\nNon coding RNA meeting- followed by lab meeting- several appts\n\nInsert date insert time date time. I spent a lot of time talking in different different meetings\n\n## Non-coding RNA\n\nThis meeting was a working group discussion on non-coding RNA. They began by discussing some issues Sam was having with workflows and output from programs like MirTrace. They determined that trimming reads to 25 bases led to more hits in the database, showing trimming has an impact. Steven shared some Markdown files documenting analysis steps and they discussed better ways to share these files. They agreed writing out methods sections ahead of time would help guide future work, even if all steps haven't been completed yet. To wrap up, they decided tomorrow's meeting should focus on working in breakout rooms to further develop introduction, methods, and other sections of their project.\n\nWorkflows and methods for genetic analysis. (0:02)\n\nAnalyzing audio transcript for microRNA analysis. (4:56)\n\nGene sequencing and merging code branches. (11:14)\n\nUsing GitHub to create documents and markdown files. (17:07)\n\nPlanning for tomorrow's meeting. (39:37)\n\n## lab meeting\n\nThe meeting began with Grace presenting her research on modeling the immune response of sea stars to sea star wasting disease. Next, Maggie discussed her past research on the effects of temperature on metabolic rate in invasive blue catfish, and her current research using ROVs to study fish assemblages on artificial reefs. Then Aspen presented her chapter on modeling meta Dyneema infections in Tanner crab, showing patterns of infection correlated with temperature, shell condition, and black mat fungus infection. The group provided feedback on her analysis and suggestions for further exploring explanations for differences in infection patterns between sites. Finally, Steven Roberts reminded everyone about monthly reporting requirements and purchasing reimbursements.\n\n## ceabigr\n\nThe meeting discussed analyzing alternative splicing in oyster genes to determine if it occurs randomly or in a directed, non-random manner between control and treated samples. They debated different methods to quantify this, such as looking at exon counts and coefficients of variation. Zach agreed to generate exon expression data for all samples. Stephen said he would work on getting this exon count data into a matrix. They also agreed to read the methods section of a relevant paper to help inform their approach. Determining the next steps for analyzing Zach's long non-coding RNA data was discussed, but the group felt it may not directly fit into the current manuscript.\n\n# November 3\n\nToday started out with the Gugino paper meeting spent most of the time looking at the response to reviewers didnâ€™t get too far. Need to deal with a figure. Also need to think of an interesting polite way to respond to crazy comments.\n\nAfter that met with Zack to talk about the coral analysis and funding in the near term that transition directly into the five liquor meeting where we spent majority of the time coding for long, non-coding RNA discovery we actually broke out in the three breakout rooms, the other one group working on short RNA and another group working on the manuscript talking about bigger picture things, it was determined that definitely in the long term will be interested in looking at kind of the evolutionary relationship with cutting RNA.\n\nThe next meeting was with Grace where we evaluated her long-term timeline to discuss projects finding courses, etc.\n\nAlso met with Kathleen talked a little bit more about EI project and monthly goals and some background on the cod project and how we will need to identify samples for our analysis\n\n# November 4\n\nYour text here...\n\n# November 5\n\nYour text here...\n\n# November 6\n\nYour text here...\n\n# November 7\n\nYour text here...\n\n# November 8\n\nYour text here...\n\n# November 9\n\nYour text here...\n\n# November 10\n\nYour text here...\n\n# November 11\n\nYour text here...\n\n# November 12\n\nYour text here...\n\n# November 13\n\nYour text here...\n\n# November 14\n\nYour text here...\n\n# November 15\n\nYour text here...\n\n# November 16\n\nYour text here...\n\n# November 17\n\nYour text here...\n\n# November 18\n\nYour text here...\n\n# November 19\n\nYour text here...\n\n# November 20\n\nYour text here...\n\n# November 21\n\nYour text here...\n\n# November 22\n\nYour text here...\n\n# November 23\n\nYour text here...\n\n# November 24\n\nYour text here...\n\n# November 25\n\nYour text here...\n\n# November 26\n\nYour text here...\n\n# November 27\n\nYour text here...\n\n# November 28\n\nYour text here...\n\n# November 29\n\nYour text here...\n\n# November 30\n\nYour text here...\n",
