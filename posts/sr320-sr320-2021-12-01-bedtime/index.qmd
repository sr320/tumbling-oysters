Having [previously](https://sr320.github.io/Eastern-BS/) taken a look at eastern oysters in OA to identify DMLs, here I attempt to take those data, redescribe and generate beds.   TLDR: https://github.com/epigeneticstoocean/2018_L18-adult-methylation/tree/main/igv


## Controls
(Trying to ID any sex differences)    

nb: <https://github.com/epigeneticstoocean/2018_L18-adult-methylation/blob/main/code/03.1-methykit.Rmd>

When setting threshold to


```
# get hyper methylated bases (0 is male, 1 female)
myDiff_c75p.hyper=getMethylDiff(myDiff_c,difference=75,qvalue=0.01,type="hyper")
#
# get hypo methylated bases
myDiff_c75p.hypo=getMethylDiff(myDiff_c,difference=75,qvalue=0.01,type="hypo")
#
# get all differentially methylated bases
myDiff_c75p=getMethylDiff(myDiff_c,difference=75,qvalue=0.01)
```

Comparison | DMLs | Hyper | Hypo | threshold
------------|-----|------|------|---------
Sex       | 15000 | 6   | 14994 | 75%


Getting the bed was not so straight forward ...

```
sex_dml <- dplyr::select(myDiff_c75p.tab, chr, start, end, meth.diff) %>%
  mutate(start = start -1) %>%
  mutate_if(is.numeric, as.integer) %>%
  mutate(TYPE ="sex_DML") %>%
  select(chr, start, end, TYPE, meth.diff)

write.table(sex_dml, file = "../analyses/sex_dml.bed", sep = "\t", row.names = FALSE, quote = FALSE)
```
file = <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/epigeneticstoocean/2018_L18-adult-methylation/main/analyses/sex_dml.bed>

## OA comparison
(ignoring sex)

Comparison | DMLs | Hyper | Hypo | threshold
------------|-----|------|------|---------
OA     | 10| 5   | 5 | 50%

## Combined comparison
(Four conditions)



Comparison | DMLs | Hyper | Hypo | threshold
------------|-----|------|------|---------
combined (4 conditions)     | 78205 | 78205   | 0 | 50%
