# February 8

Today, I started my day by signing into Zoom, which didn't take much time. I then spent a significant portion of my morning reading a scientific article on oyster reproductive processes and their impact on quality losses. This was followed by a deep dive into some data analysis, where I was working with R scripts and genomic data. This data analysis took up a large chunk of my day.

In the afternoon, I spent some time on GitHub, where I uploaded files related to DE gene expression and MWU analysis for Pacific oysters exposed to OsHV-1. This activity took a moderate amount of time. I also had a discussion on Slack about Rewind, a personalized AI tool. This discussion was relatively brief.

I also checked my email, where I was troubleshooting an error with a colleague who was experiencing the same issue. This took a fair amount of time as we were trying to resolve the issue. 

In the midst of my work, I took a short break to check in with my family. I used the Find My app to see where everyone was located. I also had a quick chat with Beyer Roberts via iMessage. These personal activities were relatively brief.

Towards the end of the day, I checked my billing information for Scite, a tool I use for my research. This was a quick task. I also looked into how Rewind's compression works, as I was curious about the storage it might consume. This was a brief activity as well.

Finally, I wrapped up my day by checking my calendar for upcoming appointments and meetings. This was a quick activity, wrapping up a day filled with a mix of research, data analysis, and communication with colleagues and family.
