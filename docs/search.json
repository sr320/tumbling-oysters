    "text": "Discussion Themes\nOne of the central themes in our groups discussion encompassed the intra-species differences in molecular stress response across various marine invertebrate species. In regards to this theme, we particularly touched upon the transcriptomic responses in stress-tolerant vs stress-susceptible organisms of the same species to environmentally relevant stressors including extreme low salinity and elevation in temperature. The term “frontloading” used in Gleason and Burton 2015 is used to describe the baseline expression of genes that improve an organisms ability to physiologically tolerate extreme periods of stress.\nThis theme of frontloading and resilience across sub-populations of marine invertebrates differs slightly from the paper I selected that also cited the Gleason and Burton 2015 paper:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitation\n\n\n\nMorin, M., M. Jönsson, C. K. Wang, D. J. Craik, S. M. Degnan, and B. M. Degnan. 2023. Captivity induces a sweeping and sustained genomic response in a starfish. Molecular Ecology:mec.16947. https://doi.org/10.1111/mec.16947.\n\n\nHere the authors report the inability of a species of starfish to acclimate to the stress that comes with removal from their native environment and introduction into captivity by describing the distinct differences in the transcriptome of wild versus captive individuals. As they evaluated the transcriptomic profiles of wild and formerly-wild starfish, it can be said that the molecular marks of chronic stress expressed by the captive starfish contrast and thus highlight the theme of stress-response frontloading. Furthermore, the paper I selected also serves as evidence for the emphasis in integrating robust methods in research investigating differential gene expression."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Summary\nFor our tutorial this week, I read the paper assigned to everyone, a Roberts lab special:\nRoberts SB and Gavery MR (2012) Is there a relationship between DNA methylation and phenotypic plasticity in invertebrates? Front. Physio. 2:116. doi: 10.3389/fphys.2011.00116\nwhich reviewed previous research on DNA methylation and phenotypic plasticity in invertebrates, particularly non-model organisms such as the western honeybee and the Pacific oyster.\nWe were required to find our own, more recent review though, which led me to this paper:\nSrut M (2021) Ecotoxicological epigenetics in invertebrates: Emerging tool for the evaluation of present and past pollution burden. Chemosphere. 282. doi: 10.1016/j.chemosphere.2021.131026 \nI will be giving summaries of both papers, comparing them, and describe an experiment that could integrate DNA methylation with my own interests in bivalve physiology.\n\n\nRoberts and Gavery Review\nThis paper summarized current work looking to link DNA methylation with phenotypic plasticity in non-model invertebrates. In summarizing previous studies, Steven and Mackenzie found that where DNA is methylated and its degree of methylation varies by species. Moreover, in species with methylation (such as bees and oysters), functionally critical genes were originally hypothesized (and shown in computer analyses) to be more methylated than tissue-specific or inducible genes, and for that methylation to carry through the germline (the next generation). The rationale is that less methylation allows for greater transcriptional flexibility, which makes sense for genes that are constantly turning on and off, unlike genes that need to be expressed constantly (such as DNA and RNA metabolism). With less methylation, the gene can be more easily accessed by transcriptional machinery. This was confirmed by Steven and Mackenzie’s sequencing of methylated regions in the oyster genome, and a study done on western honeybees. See image below.\n\n\n\nGene distribution\n\n\nMethylation also varied depending on the presence of introns. Methylated genes also appeared to be more conserved across species, and unmethylated genes have more genetic diversity and theoretically more adaptive potential and phenotypic plasticity, via more or fewer alternative splicings of a certain gene, and other pathways.\n\n\nSrut Review\nThis review focused on epigenetic modifications to invertebrate genomes following pollutant exposure, and the potential of using DNA methylation as a biomarker for pollution. The paper starts with a helpful review on what DNA methylation is and how it works before describing different studies of DNA methylation following pollutant exposure. The author then dives into how DNA methylation has changed in various invertebrates when exposed to metals, pesticides, harmful chemicals, radiation, BPA’s, etc. They include a three page table summarizing all the studies they could find. Next, they go into hypotheses of how pollutants alter methylation, with most of them involving hijacking or interruption of enzyme activity that carries out methylation. The next big chunk of the paper summarizes studies that have looked at DNA methylation after pollution over multiple generations after the original parent was exposed to a pollutant. Across multiple species and pollutants, they see mixes of hypo- and hypermethylation depending on the pollutant, the species, and the generation. The final part of the paper looks at challenges within the field of ecotoxicological epigenetics. Accessing robust bisulfite sequencing technology can often be prohibitively expensive, time-consuming, and heavily reliant on good expertise. Moreover, epigenetic data is often not linked to phenotypic expression within studies, and this is in part because of limited, well-characterized methylomes. The author also writes that in order for epigenetic data to be even relevant to ecotoxicology, the field must expand what organisms it uses so that it includes all ecologically relevant species, at different life stages, and all different tissues within an organism. The author concludes this section by saying that beyond DNA methylation, other gene regulatory (epigenetic) mechanisms need to be explored, such as non-coding RNA’s and histones.\n\n\nComparisons\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSimilarities\nDifferences\n\n\n\n\n-Agree that less DNA methylation is linked to increased plasticity -Both discussed DNA methylation in non-model organisms\n-Srut is much newer (2021), talks about more organisms and techniques -Srut talked more specifically about pollutant research, Roberts more about phenotypic plasticity -Srut’s paper talked more about genome wide methylation, Roberts more about specific genes\n\n\n\n\n\nApplications to my research\nI would love to do some targeted DNA methylation analysis in mussels that are exposed to high flow or low flow environments and see if that changes methylation in foot protein genes, given that mussels often lay more threads when exposed to higher flows. Although, that might not be super applicable, as we would likely need to see a change in the composition of the thread in order to make methylation analysis worthwhile. However, maybe there’s hypomethylation near the regulatory apparatus that controls byssal thread deposition. Could be interesting."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Summary\nFor the last week of our tutorial, we came back to DNA methylation and read another Roberts lab joint: https://doi.org/10.1111/1755-0998.13542\nAnd we also got to read another paper on our organism of choice. Mine looked at morphology and methylation in P. perna in South Africa across habitat types, either bay or open ocean mussels: https://doi.org/10.1007/s00227-018-3310-6.\nIf you want some quick summaries, look no further. You have arrived.\n\n\nTrigg et al. 2021\n3 different methods of methylation quantification (bisulfite sequencing) were used to compare methylation in two scleractinian coral species, one environmentally sensitive (P. acuta) and one not (M. capitata), and they also compared the efficacy of all three methods against each other. The three methods were whole genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS), reduced representation bisulfite sequncing (RRBS) and methyl-CpG binding domain bisulfite sequencing (MBDBS). WGBS is the top choice (and is the most expensive one) for bisulfite sequencing because it provides full coverage of the genome, and it can detect the entire methylome at single base-pair resolution, so you know exactly where the methylation is in a gene. RRBS uses restriction enzymes to enrich CPG islands, common methylation hotspots in vertebrates, but by using the enzymes only part of the genome is sequenced. MBDBS is described as “MBDBS uses methyl binding domain proteins to target and enrich methylated CpGs, then employs bisulfite conversion to provide single base-pair resolution of DNA fragments enriched for methylated regions.” Now I’m not sure hwat domain proteins are, but it sounds like these proteins find the methylated regions, and then the rest of the method uses the bisulfite conversion to provide that really high resolution.\nAcuta was far less methylated than capitata. Most of the methylation for both species was in the intergenic and intron regions. Whole genome bisulfite sequencing still comes out on top as the #1 method for figuring out methylation. However, for the corals, the MBDBS also worked pretty well for a much lower cost, with some potential misidentification of the symbiont’s genome as the coral’s genome, and a special focus on hypermethylated regions, which could be problems. RRBS covered less overall, but for what it did cover it got greater read depth. Inter-cell methylation differences may also affect MBDBS, which only pulls down methylated DNA, while the other two methods don’t “enrich” methylated regions.\n\n\nWatson et al. 2018\nThe authors used RRBS in tandem with morphological measurements to assess differences (epigenetic and otherwise) between bay and “open ocean” populations of P. perna (green-lipped mussels) in South Africa. They didn’t find any significant morphological differences between the two types of populations, but I guess they found some epigenetic difference, but the way they write about it makes it seem like they cherry-picked the data a bit. They did a PCoA with just “highly differentiated” methylation susceptible loci and then found a difference in methylation between the two types of populations, but that’s like having two piles of red apples, one with a green apple in it, and then picking up only the green apple and a red apple from the other basket and then saying “the two groups are different!” That’s my base understanding of it anyway.\n\n\nIn reference to last week\nIf last week was about the usage of DNA methylation quantification, this week was about what specific methods are best for DNA methylation quantification. We can safely say that WGBS is the best, but for marine labs that don’t quite have the same funding as those in genome sciences departments, MBDBS and RRBS could be useful enough for our purposes.\nInterestingly, last week I had an idea to look at methylation in mussels in high and low flow environments, and that’s what Watson et al. tried to do, which was cool to read. I’m not sure their data totally supports their conclusions, however."

It highlights the significant differences in epigenomic modification toolkits across taxa and suggests that they are utilized in a lineage-specific context, reflecting the evolutionary history of organisms.\nThe authors specifically focus on DNA methylation, which exhibits extraordinary diversity in animals, ranging from complete loss to expanded complements of DNMT. The study raises several unresolved questions regarding the evolutionary origins and organism-specific roles of DNA methylation systems, the transferability of data between different systems, and the distinguishing features of species without DNA methylation. Investigating organisms that have eliminated DNA methylation, such as Diptera, Placozoa, and certain Nematoda, may provide insights into the reasons behind this loss. The authors propose that eutelic or partly eutelic organisms, like Caenorhabditis elegans and tardigrades, eliminated DNA methylation to maintain strict development and enhance genome and transcriptome stability. The paper also highlights the unique case of DNA methylation in Hymenoptera, focusing on the honey bee. The honey bee’s DNA methylation toolkit exhibits variations, including gene duplication and alternative splicing, which may contribute to its phenotypic plasticity. Understanding the mechanistic aspects and functional importance of DNA methylation in insects, particularly in relation to development, behavioral maturation, and restricted gene expression, is crucial. The study acknowledges that the function of DNA methylation in insects remains poorly understood and emphasizes the need for high-resolution technologies to evaluate its involvement in development and behavioral maturation, especially in the honey bee queen-worker developmental divide. Additionally, the epigenetic control of gene expression in imaginal discs during insect development and the role of nutritional stimuli in reprogramming developmental processes are discussed as important areas of investigation."

    "text": "Comparison\nOne thing I find compelling similar about these two reviews is the call toward a better mechanistic understanding of how methylation impacts gene expression. However, I would say the Roberts and Gavery paper focuses more on functional description of the processes affected by methylation, while the Maleszka and Kucharski paper drives home the point that we cannot truly understand what methylation is actually doing without the explicit evaluation of pathways. Acknowledging that these two papers are written almost 10 years apart, it seems that some of this difference may be due to the progress in the field over the past decade. Using GO terms as a means to describe the potential functions of methylated areas appears to be the norm in most studies related to DNA methylation. It seems like we might be headed into a new era for invertebrates, born of research progress, in which we must look closer at mechanisms, similar to methylation studies completed in biomedical research, to truly test our hypotheses about DNA methylation in invertebrates. It’s also worth mentioning that both of these papers mention the transcriptional potential of unmethylated areas within the genome. Both papers likely operate under much of the same conceptual framework and ask questions about the role of DNA methylation in environmental response and preservation of necessary cellular functions (i.e. metabolism). However, the Maleszka and Kucharski paper does take specific issue with considering the functionality of all DMNTs as the same across taxa, as illustrated in Figure 1:\n\nFigure 1. DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) gene copy number and domain structure in selected organisms."

Lotterhos, J. B. Puritz, and H. M. Putnam. 2022. Invertebrate methylomes provide insight into mechanisms of environmental tolerance and reveal methodological biases. Molecular Ecology Resources 22:1247–1261.https://doi.org/10.1111/1755-0998.13542.\n\n\n\nTrigg et al. 2022 Summary:\nThis paper compares the effectiveness of three genome-wide level approaches for estimation of DNA methylation at single base-pair resolution in two non-model marine invertebrate organisms:\n\nWhole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS)\nReduce representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS)\nMethyl-CpG binding domain bisulfite sequencing (MBDBS)\n\nIn methylomics research, WGBS is the “gold standard” in bisulfite conversion sequencing as it is capable of providing full coverage of the whole methylome at a single base-pair resolution. However, this method is expensive relative to RRBS and MBDBS. Furthermore, given most marine invertebrates have a small fraction of their genomes methylated, the expense of evaluating the whole genome for methylation is not as attractive as other more affordable methods.\nRRBS enriches for CpG-rich regions of the genome through the use of restriction digestion. It was primarily designed for use in mammals that typically contain CpG islands in regulatory regions such as promoters.\nMBDBS involves the use of methyl binding domain proteins that target and enrich for methylated CpGs, then uses bisulfite conversion to ID at the single base-pair resolution fragments of DNA enriched for methylated regions. In marine invertebrates, this technique was projected to be especially useful as highly methylated areas of the genome tend to be found within gene bodies:\n\n\n\nexample of gene body\n\n\nAs such, generally speaking, since CDS regions tend to be methylated in marine invertebrates, using the enrichment approach involved in MBDBS is considered a cost-effective and method for investigating especially informative regions of the genome.\nUltimately, the authors find that the methylation landscape greatly varies across species, tissue processing methods, and library preparation methods. As such, when selecting for high-resolution quantification of DNA methylation profiles in non-model marine invertebrates, great consideration needs to be taken regarding the biology of the organism, the research question and resultant genomic regions of interest, as well as cost.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitation\n\n\n\nSun, D., H. Yu, and Q. Li. 2022. Genome-Wide Differential DNA Methylomes Provide Insights into the Infertility of Triploid Oysters. Marine Biotechnology 24:18–31.https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10126-021-10083-y.\n\n\nIn this paper, the authors investigate genome-wide methylomes and transcriptomes of fertile and infertile triploid pacific oysters and compare them to normal diploid individuals using whole genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) and RNA-seq with the objective of identifying the epigenetic mechanisms involved in gonadal development in triploid individuals.\nAn interesting finding out of this paper is that F-3nα, fertile female triploid pacific oysters, presented higher methylation levels than F-2n, normal diploid females. This contrasts with F-3nβ triploid infertile females that expressed lower methylation levels than F-2n. At first glance, this finding is intuitive, as at least previous discussions in FISH 600 have pointed towards the correlation of greater epigenetic modifications equating to greater regulation of gene expression. Since F-3nα individuals are still capable of producing a large amount of gametes despite the extra load of genomic material to control for, it would be expected to see greater investment in epigenetic modifications to the genome such as methylation especially relative to normal F-2n individuals. This idea is further supported by the evidence that F-3nβ individuals, who produce significantly less gametes, lack that epigenetic “control” of the excess genome and that may inform their ability to successfully undergo healthy gonadal development. Expanding upon this thought, the authors’ suggest that the absence of methylation in gene body regions of infertile triploid oysters likely leads to transcriptional effects relating to access to alternative start sites, alternative splicing events, and an overall increase in sequence mutations.\nThe authors pair this methylomic data with transcriptomic data and find that only 64 genes involved in metabolism are differentially expressed in fertile triploid females compared to the 272 genes in sterile triploid females relative to diploid females.\nIn terms of broader implications, this study presents a novel angle in terms of investigating gonadal development in invertebrates by evaluating epigenetic influences on the transcriptome of fertile and infertile pacific oysters.\n\n\n\nComparison with last meeting\nIn our previous meeting we discussed the broader implications of the epigenetic field and the general direction in which it was moving. This week however, we focus in on methods regarding high-throughput quantification of methylation landscapes and the direct applications of these methods such as the gold standard WGBS in elucidating mechanisms of epigenetic regulation in pathways such as gonadal development in marine invertebrates. Much of the work conducted in epigenetics is focused on methylation of the genome especially in vertebrates. The papers discussed here in this post focus in on the distinct nature of invertebrate methylomes relative to other taxa and how the unique biology of marine invertebrates like pacific oyster and coral result in methylation landscapes with unique gene expression regulatory properties."

But first, let’s back up and get on the same page. DNA methylation is an epigenetic mechanism that allows an organism to alter its genetic response to the environment without making permanent changes to its DNA.\nDNA methylation is one of the ways we understand the role of epigenetic response in organisms, but there are a few more; histone modification and non-coding RNA modification are the other mechanisms. While much work has been done to explain this temporary response to an environmental stressor, there is still plenty of work to be done with DNA methylation leading the way in research and understanding. With that said, DNA methylation manifests in either transcriptional regulation or in gene silencing and the Roberts & Gavery 2012 addresses both. While this paper was published in 2012, the role of DNA methylation as an epigenetic mechanism hasn’t changed.\nImage Caption: This graphic is from the Pham et al. 2023 review paper on epigenetic tool usage in elucidating the impact of contaminants in the aquatic environment."

    "text": "Research Application\nDNA methylation is an important variable in exploring Mytilus’ response to contaminants as the prevalence of larger and more frequent weather events pushes them to their energetic threshold of survival. The first exploration would be to quantify the percent cover of methylation across genes or physiological processes of interest and follow-up with lab experiments to determine adaptability to single- stressor and multiple- stressor environments.\nI am particularly interested in evaluating Mytilus spp. physiological response to PPCPs in coastal marine waterways through evaluating epigenetic response, heritability of response, and potential trade-offs in response to a challenging environment. An example of relevance to my work would be to quantify percent methylation coverage via BS-sequencing and follow-up with single contaminant exposure trials in mature mussels to tease out the trade-offs required to survive in a multiple-stressor environment. A control group would be exposed to standard environmental conditions prior to contaminant exposure. Treatment groups could include acute thermal stress, chronic thermal stress with a finite end, and long-term thermal stress exposures at temporal scales that mimic high temperature fluctuations related to seasonality. The next step would be to expose each treatment group to the same contaminant to determine the organism’s success in offloading the contaminant. Sampling of tissues would take place across a temporal scale that would yield the most complete picture of exposure response."

Different conditions we talked about were captivity, salinity levels, and temperature stress. Elevated thermal stress, lowered salinity, and captivity all elevated some stress related genes for all invertebrates. In particular, it seemed that organisms already living in stressful conditions had pre-adapted to their environment, as evidenced by a higher base level of stress gene activation than their unadapted counterparts. I learned what a long non-coding RNA is for the first time in my life, and I finally feel like I understand PCA graphs, to a certain extent."

They exposed the oysters to low pH conditions for seven weeks and used whole genome bisulfite sequencing to identify methylated regions in the female oyster gonad samples. The analysis revealed a total of 1284 differentially methylated loci primarily in genes associated with development and stress response. The results suggest that DNA methylation may play a regulatory role in gonad and larval development, shaping the oysters’ responses to low pH stress. The study also highlights the importance of species- and tissue-specific studies to understand the potential regulatory role of DNA methylation. The findings contribute to the growing understanding of epigenetic responses in molluscan species and provide a foundation for future research on intergenerational epigenetic inheritance and its role in mediating plastic responses to environmental stressors."

The primary paper looks generally at methylation, comparing two species of coral (one considered more environmentally sensitive than the other). The focuses here also appears to be more methodological given the 3 approaches. My paper more specifically examines methylation in the case of OA treatments in oysters. This approach seems more mechanistic than the primary paper’s approach, since it is focused on a particular treatment condition with expected physiological responses. However, both papers provide similar conclusions about the importance of acknowledging species specific (and tissue specific in the case of the oyster paper) methylation patterns."
