Went out to hatchery to re prime what is left from 10k seed on Friday Sept 13th.

Rinsed all bags with freshwater hose.

Bags 56 and 66 then went into FW (5 gallon bucket) for two hours.

47 and 30 were moved into white tank inside (far right). Water temperature 23C. (Lagoon is currently at 17C). Two heater set at 36 set to come on 11pm - 5am daily. Temperature profile is as follows.

Bags 75 and 76 were placed in FW for two hours then moved into white tank described above. 

Bags 36/37 (controls) and 50/49 (immune) simply went back to lagoon.

Still waiting for info on farm deployment but planning on going out Sunday and checking on water system (flow) and do freshwater immersions. Poly IC should arrive Monday. 


# Update Sunday Sept 15th

Went out and did FW immersion (2 hours) on 75/76 and 56/66.

Also snapped photos for documenting size and number of seed.
