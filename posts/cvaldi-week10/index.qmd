### Trigg et al. Summary:
This paper compares the effectiveness of three genome-wide level approaches for estimation of DNA methylation at single base-pair resolution in two non-model marine invertebrate organisms: 

- Whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS)
- Reduce representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS)
- Methyl-CpG binding domain bisulfite sequencing (MBDBS)

In epigenetics research, WGBS is
