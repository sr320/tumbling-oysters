One thing that I really want to get done, let's put it on a to do item and maybe if we search for to do it'll come up, but I'd like to develop some research retrospective to come up on my website to look at kind of past effort and and summarize in particularly if we're not there, they're not active areas you know I'm thinking Olympia oyster I just changed that I'm also thinking active efforts to might be might be valued #todo

\<!‚Äî block assistant ‚Äî\> Develop a research retrospective section on my website:

1.  Plan where to incorporate the section on the website, consider where it can be easily accessed and seen.
2.  Begin to gather and compile the information for past projects, focusing on non-active ones like the Olympia oyster.
3.  Write thorough summaries of each project, detailing the process, findings, and why the project ended or is currently inactive.
4.  Design the website section to be engaging and easy to understand.
5.  Build out ‚Äòactive efforts‚Äô section as well, keeping it updated with current projects and research.
6.  Once the section is ready, test for usability and functionality.
7.  Upload and monitor the performance of the new section.
8.  Consider promoting the new section through various channels to ensure it catches the attention of site visitors.

This could be a great way to showcase past achievements and pursuits. It could also aid in sparking interest in currently active projects. #todo \<!‚Äî endblock ‚Äî\>

Started my morning with a burst of productivity! üöÄ Spent several hours creating something I‚Äôm really excited about - an automated system for my notebook posts. Finally figured out how to use iOS shortcuts with GitHub to make posting updates a breeze. It‚Äôs amazing how a morning of coding can make life so much easier. Already used it to post about Sam‚Äôs DNA extraction and Ariana‚Äôs work.

By midday, found myself troubleshooting with some colleagues. Someone was having issues with file management in Raven - you know how these technical hiccups can be. Helped sort that out while discussing plans for time series methods and methylation analysis. It‚Äôs satisfying when you can help others get unstuck.

The afternoon brought a fascinating research meeting about our three-species analysis project. We dove deep into differential expression analysis and gene ontology work. The team‚Äôs making good progress, though we need to secure some additional funding for sequencing. The Wildlife Diseases Conference abstract deadline is coming up on March 1st - always keeping us on our toes!

Later in the day, had a lengthy session reviewing a scientific paper. Spent quite a bit of time fine-tuning the visualizations for symbiont-host interactions. Also tackled some grant management tasks - budgets, personnel, supplies, you name it. Earthlab and BIMS funding discussions always keep things interesting.

Note to self: Yesterday‚Äôs impromptu Seattle trip without a raincoat was not my brightest moment! üåßÔ∏è Got soaked and learned my lesson - need to start checking the weather forecast more regularly.

Looking ahead, we‚Äôve got some exciting projects in the pipeline - Yellow Island sampling, biomarker analysis, and that trip to plan for. Never a dull moment!

Today was one of those full but satisfying days. The new automated notebook system might be my favorite achievement - it‚Äôs the little things that make work life smoother, isn‚Äôt it?

What is the best way to save time writing ‚úçÔ∏è science notebook posts?

1.  Organize Your Thoughts: Before you start writing, have a clear outline of the content you want to share. This will help you write in a streamlined manner and avoid wasting time changing things later.

2.  Use Templates: If you often write about similar topics, consider creating a template that includes all the sections you typically include. This way, you won't need to start from scratch each time.

3.  Write Regularly: The more you do it, the quicker you'll get. Regular practice will help you familiarize with scientific language and structure, thus speeding up your process.

4.  Use Technology: Make use of science writing software tools, plagiarism checkers and grammar correction software to assist in creating quality content quickly.

5.  Write First, Edit Later: Avoid editing as you write. Instead, focus on getting all your ideas down first. Once you've finished, you can review what you've written and make necessary changes.

6.  Use Visuals: It often takes less time to explain complex scientific concepts using images, graphs, or charts.

7.  Break Down Complex Ideas: Instead of spending time writing lengthy explanations, break complex ideas down into simpler ones. This will make your posts easier to understand and quicker to write.

8.  Reuse Content: If you've written about a topic in the past, it's okay to reuse some of that content. Just make sure to update any outdated information.

9.  Set Time Limits: Determine how much time you want to spend on each post. This will help you stay focused and avoid wasting time on unnecessary details.

10. Delegate: If there are too many tasks on your plate, consider delegating. A collaborator or an assistant can help with research, editing, or even writing portions of the post.

‚Ä¢ They exist **outside** known protein-coding genes.

‚Ä¢ Tend to be truly **novel transcripts**.

2.  **Intronic lncRNAs** ‚Üí **Class code "i"**\*\*\*\*

‚Ä¢ These are found **inside introns** of known genes.

‚Ä¢ Some intronic lncRNAs are **functional** and could be regulatory.

3.  **Antisense lncRNAs** ‚Üí **Class code "x"**\*\*\*\*

‚Ä¢ Found on the **opposite strand** of known genes.

‚Ä¢ Might regulate **sense-strand transcription**.

4.  **Potential lncRNAs Overlapping Known Genes** ‚Üí **Class code "o"**\*\*\*\*

‚Ä¢ Need further filtering to ensure they are **not protein-coding isoforms**.

Relavant Species info

Based on the differences in life history, ecology, and biology between Acropora pulchra, Pocillopora meandrina, and Pocillopora tuahiniensis, we would expect differences in their gene regulatory mechanisms. Here's why: ‚Ä¢ Different Symbiotic Strategies and Environmental Sensitivity: The sources highlight that these species have distinct symbiotic strategies, with A. pulchra being a horizontal transmitter and both Pocillopora species being vertical transmitters. Additionally, A. pulchra is generally considered more sensitive to environmental change. These differences likely require distinct gene regulatory mechanisms to manage the acquisition, maintenance, and potential stress responses associated with their symbionts. ‚ó¶ A. pulchra needs to regulate genes involved in recognizing and incorporating symbionts from the environment, while the Pocillopora species need to regulate genes for the inheritance of symbionts. ‚ó¶ The higher environmental sensitivity of A. pulchra suggests that its gene regulatory mechanisms may be more responsive to environmental stressors, leading to differential gene expression patterns compared to the Pocillopora species. ‚Ä¢ Symbiont Community Composition: Each species associates with different dominant Symbiodiniaceae species and profiles. This variation in symbiont partners is likely to influence host gene expression, as different symbionts may produce different signaling molecules or metabolites that interact with host gene regulatory pathways. ‚ó¶ For example, the sources found that symbiont community composition was significantly related to host physiology in Porites. This suggests that the specific types of symbionts present can influence host gene expression patterns. ‚Ä¢ Cryptic Diversity and Holobiont Identity: The sources emphasize the presence of cryptic diversity within the Pocillopora genus and the importance of considering holobiont identity. Even within the same species, different host haplotypes can exhibit distinct physiological responses and associate with different symbiont communities. This suggests potential genetic differences in gene regulatory mechanisms between holobionts. ‚Ä¢ Physiological Differences: The sources detail significant physiological differences between these species, indicating that their gene regulatory mechanisms must be tuned to support their distinct physiological needs. ‚ó¶ For example, the sources note that Porites corals, with their thicker tissues, have higher overall physiological rates compared to Acropora and Pocillopora. This would necessitate differences in the regulation of genes involved in metabolic processes, growth, and calcification. ‚Ä¢ Morphological Differences: The sources describe differences in tissue structure, with Acropora and Porites having perforate tissues and Pocillopora having imperforate tissues. These morphological differences could influence the microenvironment experienced by the coral host and its symbionts, potentially leading to differences in gene expression patterns. ‚ó¶ For example, perforate tissues might allow for greater exchange of nutrients and gases, which could affect metabolic processes and the regulation of related genes. Overall, the sources provide strong evidence that the different life histories, ecologies, symbiont communities, and physiologies of Acropora pulchra, Pocillopora meandrina, and Pocillopora tuahiniensis are likely associated with differences in their gene regulatory mechanisms. Further research, specifically focusing on gene expression analysis across these species, would be needed to confirm and explore the specific nature of these differences.

Today in RStudio, I focused on several tasks related to my project "bestblogever." I worked on rendering and saving files using Quarto for document preparation and management. I also engaged in coding activities, which included running shell scripts and managing directories and files for data processing. This involved setting up directories, creating checkpoint files, and running Bismark alignments, typically used for DNA methylation analysis. I ensured that the scripts executed successfully by checking command outputs and logging the results.

Additionally, I was involved in version control activities, such as staging, committing, and pushing changes to my Git repository. This included reviewing changes in various HTML and XML files related to my project documentation. I also managed my RStudio environment by loading workspaces and utilizing various RStudio features like the console, terminal, and background jobs.
