I then spent a significant portion of my morning reading a scientific article on oyster reproductive processes and their impact on quality losses. This was followed by a deep dive into some data analysis, where I was working with R scripts and genomic data. This data analysis took up a large chunk of my day.\n\nIn the afternoon, I spent some time on GitHub, where I uploaded files related to DE gene expression and MWU analysis for Pacific oysters exposed to OsHV-1. This activity took a moderate amount of time. I also had a discussion on Slack about Rewind, a personalized AI tool. This discussion was relatively brief.\n\nI also checked my email, where I was troubleshooting an error with a colleague who was experiencing the same issue. This took a fair amount of time as we were trying to resolve the issue.\n\nIn the midst of my work, I took a short break to check in with my family. I used the Find My app to see where everyone was located. I also had a quick chat with Beyer Roberts via iMessage. These personal activities were relatively brief.\n\nTowards the end of the day, I checked my billing information for Scite, a tool I use for my research. This was a quick task. I also looked into how Rewind's compression works, as I was curious about the storage it might consume. This was a brief activity as well.\n\nFinally, I wrapped up my day by checking my calendar for upcoming appointments and meetings. This was a quick activity, wrapping up a day filled with a mix of research, data analysis, and communication with colleagues and family.\n\n# February 9\n\nI started my morning by checking my emails, where I reviewed a draft proposal from Megan Ewing. I then visited the GitHub profile of Ariana S. Huffmyer, a postdoctoral researcher studying the effects of climate change on coral physiology.\n\nNext, I worked on a project in RStudio, which seemed to be related to my research. I also checked my Slack workspace, where I had several unread messages and upcoming meetings. I participated in a Zoom meeting with several of my colleagues, including Ross Cunning, Dr. Hollie Putnam, and Roger Nisbet.\n\nI spent some time managing my files and possibly editing images or documents. I reviewed a document related to DNA methylation analysis and sex determination in oysters. I also engaged in a discussion on Slack about the next steps for analysis given the differential effects of haplotype on physiology and ITS2.\n\nI visited the Roberts Lab Handbook, possibly to review lab protocols or guidelines. I also spent some time on a project related to oyster survival after heat challenges.\n\nIn summary, my morning was filled with a mix of collaborative meetings, individual work on research projects, and administrative tasks.\n\n```         \n\n# Define the vectors for controls and exposed\ncontrols_females <- c(\"S16F\", \"S19F\", \"S39F\", \"S44F\", \"S52F\", \"S53F\", \"S54F\", \"S76F\")\nexposed_females <- c(\"S22F\", \"S29F\", \"S35F\", \"S36F\", \"S3F\", \"S41F\", \"S50F\", \"S77F\") # Assuming \"S77\" was intended to be \"S77F\"\n\n\n# Initialize an empty list to store the modified data frames\nfiltered_logdata_frames <- list()\n\n# Loop through the list of data frames, filter, and add a source column\nfor (name in names(logdata_frames)) {\n  # Filter the dataframe and add a new column 'Source' with the name of the dataframe\n  filtered_logdata_frames[[name]] <- logdata_frames[[name]] %>%\n    filter(GeneID == \"LOC111099033\") %>%\n    mutate(Source = name) %>%\n    mutate(Exposure_Status = case_when(\n    Source %in% controls_females ~ \"control\",\n    Source %in% exposed_females ~ \"exposed\",\n    TRUE ~ NA_character_ # This line handles any Source not in the two lists\n  ))\n\n}\n\n# Merge all the modified dataframes in the list into a new single dataframe\nmerged_dataframe <- bind_rows(filtered_logdata_frames)\n```\n\n```         \n# Assuming merged_dataframe is your final data frame\n\n# Reshape the data from wide to long format\nlong_dataframe <- pivot_longer(merged_dataframe, \n                               cols = starts_with(\"fold\"),\n                               names_to = \"Fold\",\n                               values_to = \"Value\")\n\n# Plot the data\nggplot(long_dataframe, aes(x = Fold, y = Value, group = Source, color = Exposure_Status)) +\n  geom_line() +\n  geom_point() +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(title = \"LOC111099033\",\n       x = \"Fold\",\n       y = \"Value\") +\n  scale_color_viridis_d() # Optional: Use a viridis color scale for better visibility\n```\n\nPI Meeting\n\n1.

We also discussed methylation analysis and planned for an intergroup collaboration meeting. After the meeting, I had a Zoom call with Steven Roberts and Megan Ewing.\n\nI spent a significant part of my day working on a research project related to the molecular mechanisms in coral resilience and environmental triggers. I delved into the epigenetic modifications and their relationship to environmental changes. I also worked on a manuscript related to simulation and environment tracking.\n\nI spent some time on my computer, navigating through various applications and websites. I checked my emails, visited the Roberts Lab website, and used the Slack application for communication. I also worked on gene expression data and referenced the Ostrea edulis genome assembly.\n\nI worked on a proposal draft where I aimed to identify genes associated with sex determination in Olympia oysters and determine the impact of temperature on the expression of identified genes. I also referenced genomic data from the Roberts Lab GitHub repository.\n\nI also spent some time reading a research paper on the gonad transcriptome analysis of pearl oyster Pinctada margaritifera, which helped me identify potential sex differentiation and sex-determining genes.\n\nThroughout the day, I used various bioinformatics tools and databases for my research work. I used the NCBI database for genome assembly data , and I also used R for data analysis. I also referenced some code on GitHub for joining differentially expressed genes (DEGs) with Blast results and UniProt Gene Ontology annotations.\n\nIn summary, my day was filled with meetings, research work, data analysis, and reading relevant literature to support my ongoing projects. I interacted with my colleagues through various platforms and used a variety of tools and databases to aid my research.\n\n# February 10\n\nToday, I've been quite productive. I started my day by checking my calendar and planning my activities. I then focused on my research grants, reviewing and updating the information in the \"Find Grants by PI R1209\" document. I also worked on a spreadsheet related to my research funding, ensuring all the details were accurate and up-to-date.\n\nIn the midst of these tasks, I took some time to revisit a presentation I had prepared earlier, titled \"2019-MonsterJam.key\". I also looked at some old photos from my time at the Duke University Marine Lab. This brought back memories of the research and collaborations I had been part of during that period.\n\nI also spent some time on the Roberts Lab website, updating information and reviewing recent activities. I made sure to update the status of various research projects and proposals. I also uploaded a document titled \"2023_WSG_proposal-2.pdf\" to Droplr.\n\nTowards the end of the day, I revisited a manuscript titled \"20230519_Revised_Manuscript - FFAR-Geoduck\" on Google Drive. This allowed me to review the progress made on this research and plan for the next steps.\n\nOverall, it's been a day filled with a mix of administrative tasks, research work, and a bit of reminiscing about past projects. I'm satisfied with the progress I've made and look forward to what tomorrow brings.\n\n# February 11\n\nOn February 11, I had a busy day filled with various work-related activities.
